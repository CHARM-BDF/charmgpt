  "llmNotes": "```yaml\nfileType: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)\ncontentSummary: The file appears to be a dataset containing employee information such as ID, name, email, department, role, hire date, and salary.\nkeyFeatures:\n  - Tabular data structure with rows and columns\n  - Header row with column names\n  - Each row represents an employee record\n  - Columns include employee ID, name, email, department, role, hire date, and salary\n  - Data is delimited by commas\nrecommendations:\n  - Use a CSV parsing library or built-in functions in your programming language to read and process the data\n  - Validate the data types of each column (e.g., ID and salary should be numeric, hire_date should be a date format)\n  - Handle potential issues like missing values, inconsistent formatting, or duplicate entries\n  - Consider separating the data into different data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, or objects) based on your use case\n  - Implement data filtering, sorting, or aggregation operations based on specific requirements (e.g., group employees by department, filter by hire date range)\n  - Ensure proper handling of string data, such as names and emails, which may contain special characters or whitespace\n  - If working with large datasets, consider optimizations like reading the file in chunks or using streaming techniques to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory at once\n```",
