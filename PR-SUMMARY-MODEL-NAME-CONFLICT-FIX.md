# PR Summary: Fix Model Name Conflicts When Switching Providers

## Overview
This PR fixes an issue where switching between LLM providers was causing model name conflicts. The system would continue using Claude's model name even when switching to OpenAI or Gemini, resulting in API errors.

## Changes
- Added provider-specific default model handling in the `LLMService` class
- Implemented a method to detect incompatible model names
- Ensured each provider uses the correct default model:
  - Anthropic: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
  - OpenAI: `gpt-4-turbo-preview`
  - Gemini: `gemini-1.5-flash`
  - Ollama: `llama3:latest`
- Added detailed logging for model selection and provider changes

## Testing
- Tested with curl requests to the `/api/chat-artifacts` endpoint
- Confirmed through logs that each provider now uses its own compatible model

## Documentation
- Added a detailed explanation in `README.MODEL-NAME-CONFLICT-FIX.md`
- Updated the implementation plan in `README.PLAN.expandLLMoptions.md`
