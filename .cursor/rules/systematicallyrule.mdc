ONLY DO THE MINIMUM CODING FOR THE NEXT STEP
IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE THINGS THAT  OULD WORK THEN TRY THE ONE YOU THINK WILL MOST LIKELY ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL WITH THE MINIMUM CHANGES. THEN STOP CODING AND TELL ME WHAT ELSE YOU CAN TRY IF THAT DOES NOT WORK.
YOU TENDENCY IS TO BE OVERLLY ENTHUSIASTIC, BUT THAT OFTEN ENDS IN BREAKING OTHER CODE WHILE MAKING THE FIX YOU ARE HELPING WITH.
