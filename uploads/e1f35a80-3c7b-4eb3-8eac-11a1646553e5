Funding Opportunity Purpose

This NOFO solicits proposals that stimulate innovation and advance understanding of when, where, and how best to implement the use and sharing of genomic information and technologies in clinical care  provided to all persons irrespective of racial/ethnic background or socioeconomic status.

Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives 

The NIH recognizes that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogeneous teams. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved populations participate in, and benefit from research, and enhancing public trust. To support the best science, the NIH encourages inclusivity in research. Examples of structures that promote diverse perspectives include but are not limited to: 

-   Transdisciplinary research projects and collaborations among neuroscientists and researchers from fields such as computational biology, physics, engineering, mathematics, computer and data sciences, as well as bioethics.
-   Engagement from different types of institutions and organizations (e.g., research-intensive, undergraduate-focused, minority-serving, community-based). 
-   Individual applications and partnerships that enhance geographic and regional heterogeneity. 
-   Investigators and teams composed of researchers at different career stages. 
-   Participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including groups traditionally underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research workforce (see NOT-OD-20-031), such as underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, those with disabilities, those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women. 
-   Opportunities to enhance the research environment to benefit early- and mid-career investigators. 

This NOFO requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP), which will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation. Applications that fail to include a PEDP will be considered incomplete and will be withdrawn. Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the NOFO instructions carefully and view the available PEDP guidance material.

## Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description

#### Purpose

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites proposals that stimulate innovation and advance understanding of when, where, and how best to implement the use and sharing of genomic information and technologies in clinical care provided to all persons irrespective of racial/ethnic background or socioeconomic status. Applications should focus on genomic medicine, defined as using genomic information about an individual as part of their clinical care (e.g., for screening, diagnostic, or therapeutic decision-making) and the health outcomes and policy implications of that clinical use.

NHGRI supports studies that provide generalizable methods and knowledge. Applications for studies relevant only to a particular disease or organ system should be directed to the appropriate Institute or Center. Similarly, projects that focus only on a gene or limited set of genes will not be appropriate for NHGRI funding unless broad applicability is clearly explained and use of a single gene or limited set of genes is well justified. All applications, regardless of focus, should explain how generalizable, broadly useful, and transformative the findings and approaches will be to the field of genomic medicine.

#### Background

The past decade has seen a significant growth in the implementation of genomics in clinical practice. NHGRI has primarily funded genomic medicine research through multi-disciplinary consortia, which provide rich opportunities for collaboration or ancillary projects and have produced valuable data resources and tools for independent genomic medicine research (for more information about these programs, see [https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Division-of-Genomic-Medicine](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Division-of-Genomic-Medicine)). As the field grows, opportunities for focused research projects outside large-scale coordinated consortium approaches are growing as well. This funding opportunity invites proposals for these type of research projects.

This funding opportunity is a renewal of [RFA-HG-20-036](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HG-20-036.html).

#### Scope and Objectives

This NOFO centers on addressing research gaps related to the use of genomic information to advance the application of genomics in clinical care.

In the context of their relevance to genomic medicine, the following are some examples of the areas of research studies that would be appropriate for this NOFO, grouped by category:

_**Implementing genomic medicine**_

Implementation research projects would elucidate whether use of genomic information about an individual improves clinical care and/or health outcomes, or how best to implement genomic medicine.

-   Understanding facilitators and barriers in implementation of genomic medicine and pharmacogenomics across broad settings, especially their diffusion and sustainability in various clinical settings.
-   Identifying and assessing implementation science frameworks that can be used to study genomic medicine in academic clinical settings, non-academic clinical settings, or both.
-   Developing computational, health-economic, or other analytical approaches that identify characteristics of participants likely to derive the greatest (or conversely, the least) value from incorporating various types of genomic data into clinical care. Applicants considering health-economic approaches should review NOT-OD-16-025, “Clarifying NIH Priorities for Health Economics Research,” [https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-025.html](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-025.html).
-   Comparing health care utilization or disease outcomes with and without implementation of clinical decision support tools for genomics.
-   Assessing, innovating, scaling, and/or researching the implementation of novel genetic counseling practices to address the need for more healthcare professionals trained in genetic counseling.

_**Facilitating analysis of clinical genomic data**_

The pace and volume of genomic data being generated presents challenges and opportunities for methods and tools that facilitate clinical analysis. Projects could involve building and testing tools.

-   Methods that automate or otherwise improve the efficiency of clinical annotation and interpretation of genomic variants, especially those that allow for dynamic interpretation as knowledge of variants and clinical recommendations evolve. Applications focused on establishment of a genomics-enabled learning health system should consider the Notice of Funding Opportunity for Genomics-Enabled Learning Health Systems Clinical Sites U01 ([NOT-HG-23-044](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HG-23-044.html)).
-   Integrating genomic data from various sources with other data types such as environmental data, family history, social determinants of health, transcriptomics, epigenomics, functional data, or model organism data and assessing genomic data’s contributions to and improvements in predictive value, clinical validity, and/or clinical utility. Applications primarily focused on developing novel approaches to study how genetic variants lead to differences in function and how such functional differences affect health and disease processes are not responsive to this RFA and should respond to the Parent R01 ([PA-20-183](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-183.html) for Clinical Trials [PA-20-185](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pa-20-185.html) for studies not Clinical Trials) or Parent R21 ([PA-20-194](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-194.html) for Clinical Trials or [PA-120-195](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-195.html) for studies not Clinical Trials).

_**Improving clinical access and sharing of genomic data**_

Clinical access and sharing of genomic data is critical to promoting genomic medicine.

-   Assessing genomic data integration throughout health systems and how genomic information influences healthcare providers, payers, and regulators.
-   Enhancing portability of genomic data that uses standards for genomic information and allows for iterative use (e.g., integration with EHR apps, transporting to other care systems).

**NCI areas of interest**

-   Evaluating the implementation of cancer genomic data in underserved populations and/or assessing the communication of genomic test results and potential uncertainty of interpretation. 
-   Assessing the implementation of cancer genomic testing in accordance to clinical guidelines and evaluating cancer outcomes among underserved populations
-   Examining utility of germline genetic data for informing cancer screening, prevention and control
-   Integrating cancer specific genomic data from various sources with other data types such as environmental data, family history, transcriptomics, epigenomics, functional data, or model organism data and assessing genomic data’s contributions to and improvements in predictive value, clinical validity, and/or clinical utility.
-   Assessing cancer genomic data integration throughout health systems and the impact on cancer outcomes.
-   Leveraging or enhancing of relevant NCI resources and investments for identifying and recruiting cancer cases, for incorporating data through linkages to existing databases with relevant exposure, administrative, and health-related data, for community engagement, and for cost-effective exposure assessment and genomic profiling.

Investigators new to the field of genomic medicine are encouraged to apply, especially those not previously funded under [RFA-HG-20-036](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HG-20-036.html). Genomic medicine research is a multidisciplinary field and research teams may include experts from multiple disciplines, including but not limited to the fields of clinical genetics including genetic counseling and nursing, as well as genetic epidemiology, biostatistics, data science, public health, implementation science, health outcomes research, health economics, health equity and disparities, health policy, and molecular genetics.

A health disparity is a health difference that adversely affects disadvantaged populations, based on one or more of the following health outcomes:

-   Higher incidence and/or prevalence and earlier onset of disease
-   Higher prevalence of risk factors, unhealthy behaviors, or clinical measures in the causal pathway of a disease outcome
-   Higher rates of condition-specific symptoms, reduced global daily functioning, or self-reported health-related quality of life using standardized measures
-   Premature and/or excessive mortality from diseases where population rates differ
-   Greater global burden of disease using a standardized metric. [https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plan/nih-strategic-plan-definitions-and-parameters.html](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plan/nih-strategic-plan-definitions-and-parameters.html). 

Studies addressing or incorporating health disparities(for example, studies focusing on differences in health outcomes for defined disadvantaged populations that are worse than the White reference population, [https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plan/nih-strategic-plan-definitions-and-parameters.html](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plan/nih-strategic-plan-definitions-and-parameters.html)) are encouraged. For NIH, populations that experience health disparities may include racial and ethnic minority groups, people with lower socioeconomic status, underserved rural communities, and sexual and gender minority groups, and people with disabilities.

Studies that take place outside academic research settings or can demonstrate the ability for findings to be transferable to settings outside academic settings are also encouraged. Where applicable, investigators are strongly encouraged to consider various models for community engagement in research and plan and budget for the implementation of meaningful approaches across various stages of proposed research projects (e.g., generation of research questions and hypotheses, interpretation and translation of findings, dissemination of findings). For example, studies involving tribal participants or data should consider consultation and engagement with tribal leaders at the start of project planning and continue through post-implementation. Applicants are encouraged to get feedback from the communities in which the research will be performed regarding plans for sharing individual level data resulting from the research projects with the scientific community for research purposes. Feedback and recommendations for data access, protection of participant and patient privacy and confidentiality, and management of health information should be integrated into the Data Management and Sharing Plan. Note that any project receiving NIH funding that collects or uses identifiable, sensitive information is automatically deemed issued a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC).  

**NHGRI areas of interest**

NHGRI is committed to maximizing the utility of genomics for all populations. Racial and ethnic minority populations, underserved populations, and populations who experience poorer medical outcomes have been vastly underrepresented in genomic research to date.Lack of diversity in health research study populations  is widely recognized to seriously impair investigators' ability to interpret genomic variants and use them in clinical care across the spectrum of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to care, and health and morbidity. Understanding and use of the vastness of human genetic variation for clinical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment require studying of genomic variation and its health consequences across sociodemographic groups. For this reason, projects are strongly encouraged to include ancestrally diverse   populations and research study participants from groups shown to be nationally underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences research.  

Population descriptors measuring the complex concepts of race, ethnicity, genealogical ancestry and genetic ancestry are commonly employed in biomedical, health services, genomic and ELSI research. In the United States, there are real and measurable impacts of one’s racial, ethnic or ancestral identity on health, wellness, and life experiences. It may be valid and valuable to use population descriptors in a given analytical context. However, in some cases socially constructed population descriptors like race and ethnicity are used as proxies for human genetic variation in genetic and genomic research, which can lead to conflation between social and biological groups and can cause harm ([NASEM Report Using Population Descriptors in Genetics and Genomics Research](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/use-of-race-ethnicity-and-ancestry-as-population-descriptors-in-genomics-research "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site")). Similarly, sex, gender, gender identity and sexual orientation are complex, related constructs that are conceptually distinct ([NASEM Consensus Report, Measuring Sex, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26424/measuring-sex-gender-identity-and-sexual-orientation "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site")). They are commonly studied aspects of human identity that impact health, access to health care services, and experiences with discrimination; however, they are often mismeasured and misrepresented in research. Overall, the scientific questions to be addressed should guide whether and which population descriptors are used in a given study. Investigators should use established theory, frameworks, or scientific evidence to inform their use of population descriptors. To enhance the rigor and replication of proposed research, applications should be transparent in the Research Plan about the use of population descriptors. 

Per [NOT-HG-21-022](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HG-21-022.html#:~:text=NOT%2DHG%2D21%2D022,Quality%20Metadata%20and%20Phenotypic%20Data), NHGRI expects applications awarded under this NOFO to share comprehensive metadata and phenotypic, clinical, and environmental exposure data associated with the study; use standardized data collection protocols and survey instruments for capturing data, as appropriate; and use standardized notation for metadata (e.g. controlled vocabularies or ontologies) to enable the harmonization of datasets for secondary research analyses. NHGRI strongly encourages investigators that plan to collect phenotype and/or environmental exposure data about their study participants to utilize standard protocols included in the PhenX Toolkit ([http://www.phenxtoolkit.org](http://www.phenxtoolkit.org "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site")). Where possible and applicable, investigators should adhere to GA4GH standards ([https://www.ga4gh.org](https://www.ga4gh.org "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site")) and phenotype standardization efforts such as the Human Phenotype Ontology ([HPO](https://hpo.jax.org/app/ "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site")) and [Monarch](https://monarchinitiative.org/ "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"). Applicants are also encouraged to learn about NHGRI genomic medicine research programs to identify possible synergies ([https://www.genome.gov/27551170/division-of-genomic-medicine-current-research-programs/](https://www.genome.gov/27551170/division-of-genomic-medicine-current-research-programs/)).

In addition, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) may be needed for new genomic technology methods used in clinical care, separate from the requirement for the test to have been conducted within a CLIA-certified environment. Applicants may wish to consult the following Points to Consider in Assessing When an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Might be Needed: [http://www.genome.gov/27561291.](http://www.genome.gov/27561291.)

To promote progress in the genomic medicine field, awardees will be required to budget for and participate actively and openly in at least one grantee meeting per year with other awardees and NHGRI staff. Substantial information sharing will be required as appropriate and consistent with achieving the goals of the program and is a condition of the award; failure to openly share information may be grounds for discontinuation of funding. These annual meetings will serve as venues to facilitate sharing of research findings; promote the exchange of ideas; enable discussion of opportunities, challenges, and emerging needs; develop expertise and abilities among collaborators newer to genomic medicine; and accelerate progress in genomic medicine. Other investigators in the field may be invited to participate in these grantee meetings.

#### Data Sharing

NHGRI recognizes that data sharing is essential to advance genomic research and will expect recipients to comply with the NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy ([NOT-OD-21-013](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html)) and NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy ([NOT-OD-14-124](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-14-124.html)). NHGRI supports the broadest appropriate data sharing with timely data release through widely accessible data repositories, such as the [NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space (AnVIL)](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Computational-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Program/Genomic-Analysis-Visualization-Informatics-Lab-space-AnVIL). Please follow the NIH guidance on [W riting a Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Plan](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/planning-and-budgeting-for-data-management-and-sharing/writing-a-data-management-and-sharing-plan) , and ensure the Plan is in alignment with NHGRI’s data sharing expectations, which are summarized at [genome.gov/data-sharing](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Policies-Guidance/Data-Sharing-Policies-and-Expectations).

#### Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP)

This NOFO requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP) as described in [NOT-MH-21-310](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-21-310.html), submitted as Other Project Information as an attachment (see Section IV). The PEDP will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation. Applications that fail to include a PEDP will be considered incomplete and will be withdrawn.

Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the NOFO instructions carefully and view the available [PEDP guidance material](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/vision/plan-enhancing-diverse-perspectives). The PEDP will also be considered among programmatic matters with respect to funding decisions.

See [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) for award authorities and regulations.

**Research Strategy**

As part of the significance section, applicants should describe the generalizability and broader relevance of the proposed research to genomic medicine beyond any targeted genes, diseases, or clinical settings included in their specific application. Applicants should clarify how their proposed work will improve understanding of how genomic data may impact disease prevention, diagnosis or treatment, and accelerate the appropriate implementation of genomics in clinical settings. As part of the innovation section, applicants should describe the novelty of their research and detail how it is distinct from existing research efforts in genomic medicine.

Stakeholder engagement can enhance the translation of research results into clinical care and public health and address disparities in health and healthcare. Investigators are encouraged to solicit and be responsive to input of stakeholders such as professional societies, payers, public health and regulatory agencies, communities, patients, patient groups, or caregivers regarding study design, conduct, and outcomes, and to collaborate with relevant stakeholders throughout the research process. As relevant to study aims, applicants are encouraged to provide a plan to include stakeholders in the process of prioritizing, designing, and conducting research.

Applicants proposing generation of new genomic data should provide details on the costs, turn-around-time and computational requirements, including data analysis and storage, for the proposed data. They should address plans for return of results to patients and participants. Due to regulatory requirements for using research results in clinical care, applicants should describe which genomic data will be produced in compliance with the [Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA).

Applicants proposing use of existing genomic data should provide details on the source of the data, including quality control metrics, demographics of participants, appropriateness of existing consent for proposed aims and genomic data sharing, and potential for re-contacting the participants to collect additional information as needed.

Applications proposing research into the potential role of genomic information on the reduction of health disparities should clearly identify the evidence for health disparities for the disease(s) or outcome(s) studied, the role of non-genetic factors that may contribute to the health disparities, and how their specific project will inform the potential reduction of health disparities.  Applications that include population groups traditionally under-represented in genomic medicine research should clearly identify the evidence that the population(s) is under-represented in genomic medicine research and the scientific questions that will be addressed within the population(s).

Research projects that will use population descriptors in the analyses should name and define those variables, provide a rationale for their use and note any associated limitations. Variables whose use should be explained include population descriptors related to race, ethnicity, genealogical ancestry, genetic ancestry, sex, gender, and sexual orientation. The rationale should be supported by established theory, frameworks, or scientific evidence. The Research Strategy should describe how planned use of the selected variables relates to the proposed research question(s), and describe any assumptions or limitations associated with their use.

Applications should include plans to participate actively and openly in grantee meetings and in ways that contribute substantially to advancement of the field. The budget should include travel costs for at least one PD/PI and one other key personnel and/or trainee for the yearly grantee meeting.

**Resource Sharing Plan**: Individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the Resource Sharing Plans as provided in the SF424 (R&R) Application Guide.

 The following instructions also apply:

-   Applications involving development of methods, software, or other tools for genomic medicine should include detailed plans where applicable with timelines for disseminating them to the community so they are readily usable.
-   Methods, tools, and software should be well-documented and where applicable made available via public repositories.

**Other Plan(s):** Note: Effective for due dates on or after January 25, 2023, the Data Management and Sharing Plan will be attached in the Other Plan(s) attachment in FORMS-H application forms packages.

All instructions in the SF424 (R&R) Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:

-   All applicants planning research (funded or conducted in whole or in part by NIH) that results in the generation of scientific data are required to comply with the instructions for the Data Management and Sharing Plan. All applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a Data Management and Sharing Plan.
-   Please follow the NIH guidance on writing a Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Plan [here](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/planning-and-budgeting-for-data-management-and-sharing/writing-a-data-management-and-sharing-plan), and ensure the Plan is in alignment with NHGRI’s data sharing expectations, summarized in the succeeding paragraphs and detailed at [genome.gov/data-sharing](https://genome.gov/data-sharing).
-   To ensure that maximal scientific benefit is derived from this significant public investment, this funding opportunity aims to advance and accelerate research by supporting rapid sharing of the resulting data with the broad scientific community for research use, through submission of all data to widely accessible data repositories, such as the [NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space (AnVIL)](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Computational-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Program/Genomic-Analysis-Visualization-Informatics-Lab-space-AnVIL), through submission of variant interpretations to ClinVar, and through publication in the scientific literature. 
-   Applicants proposing datasets including participants from European nations or derived from European sources should address the extent to which the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/ "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site") will impact data sharing and collaborative analyses proposed in this FOA.
-   Per [NOT-HG-21-022](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HG-21-022.html#:~:text=NOT%2DHG%2D21%2D022,Quality%20Metadata%20and%20Phenotypic%20Data), NHGRI expects applications awarded under this NOFO to share comprehensive metadata and phenotypic, clinical, and environmental exposure data associated with the study; use standardized data collection protocols and survey instruments for capturing data, as appropriate; and use standardized notation for metadata (e.g. controlled vocabularies or ontologies) to enable the harmonization of datasets for secondary research analyses. NHGRI strongly encourages investigators that plan to collect phenotype and/or environmental exposure data about their study participants to utilize standard protocols included in the PhenX Toolkit ([http://www.phenxtoolkit.org](http://www.phenxtoolkit.org "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site")). Where possible and applicable, investigators should adhere to GA4GH standards ([https://www.ga4gh.org](https://www.ga4gh.org "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site")) and phenotype standardization efforts such as the Human Phenotype Ontology ([HPO](https://hpo.jax.org/app/ "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site")) and [Monarch](https://monarchinitiative.org/ "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"). Applicants are also encouraged to learn about NHGRI genomic medicine research programs to identify possible synergies ([https://www.genome.gov/27551170/division-of-genomic-medicine-current-research-programs/](https://www.genome.gov/27551170/division-of-genomic-medicine-current-research-programs/)).
-   Where human biological samples will be studied, they are expected to have been obtained using a documented informed consent process that allows for future research use and broad data sharing (NOT-HG-20-011). If new human biospecimens will be collected, or if clinical application is included in the application, the consent process should be described at a high level in the Research Plan and detailed in the Human Subjects Section.
-   NHGRI strongly encourages studies that propose to derive genomic data from human specimens and cell lines to obtain participant consent either for general research use through controlled access or for unrestricted access. Similarly, consent language should avoid both restrictions on the types of users who may access the data and restrictions that add additional requirements to the access request process. NHGRI acknowledges that this will not always be possible or appropriate. In addition, individual participants who do not consent to future research use or broad sharing of their data (i.e., submission of their data to a publicly accessible data repository) may still participate in the primary study if consistent with study design. Additional guidance on informed consent can be found in the NHGRI Informed Consent Resource.

## Section VI. Award Administration Information

1\. Award Notices

If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request "just-in-time" information from the applicant as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82418).

A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official.

Recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.6. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.

Any application awarded in response to this NOFO will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/part_ii_subpart_b.htm) website.  This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.

Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA.

ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ([https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm)

Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.

Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data\_safety.htm](//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm) and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398).

Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).

2\. Administrative and National Policy Requirements

All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11159), including of note, but not limited to:

-   [Federal-wide Standard Terms and Conditions for Research Grants](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_3/3.1_federalwide_standard_terms_and_conditions_for_research_grants.htm)
-   [Prohibition on Certain Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82417)
-   [Acknowledgment of Federal Funding](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_4/4.2.1_acknowledgement_of_federal_funding.htm)

If a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.

Should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS will be required to complete an [HHS Assurance of Compliance form (HHS 690)](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/aoc/instruction.jsf) in which the recipient agrees, as a term and condition of receiving the grant, to administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, sex and disability, and agreeing to comply with federal conscience laws, where applicable. This includes ensuring that entities take meaningful steps to provide meaningful access to persons with limited English proficiency; and ensuring effective communication with persons with disabilities. Where applicable, Title XI and Section 1557 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and gender identity. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html).

HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.

-   For guidance on administering programs in compliance with applicable federal religious nondiscrimination laws and applicable federal conscience protection and associated anti-discrimination laws see [https://www.hhs.gov/conscience/conscience-protections/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/conscience/conscience-protections/index.html) and [https://www.hhs.gov/conscience/religious-freedom/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/conscience/religious-freedom/index.html).

Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697.

In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 and 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.”
