**SPECIFIC AIMS**   
This project (BEACONS \- Biomedical Embeddings for Actionable Classification, Onset prediction, Navigation, and Stratification) addresses the diagnostic and prognostic challenges that arise when attempting to treat individuals with conditions marked by complexity, uncertainty, and high healthcare costs. Emerging evidence suggests that such conditions, which would include Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, fibromyalgia, and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, once deemed complex, have identifiable genetic, metabolic, or immune-mediated causes, requiring a paradigm shift in diagnostics. Despite advances in precision medicine and diagnostics, patients with these hard-to-diagnose diseases often face **inconclusive evaluations, missed diagnoses, and restricted access to molecular testing and expertise**. In non specialty settings, this leads to symptom mismanagement, repeat testing, and increased reliance on primary and emergency care, escalating costs and straining healthcare systems. This proposal will develop, test, and implement methods to **close these gaps**, reducing diagnostic delays, improving diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, and enhancing outcomes. While focused on complex disease, these approaches can be applied in any setting with detectable early molecular or clinical signals, including rare disease, to enhance diagnostic precision and care.  
Embeddings are a powerful tool for transforming complex, high-dimensional data, such as clinical notes, lab values, and comorbidities, into numerical vectors that enable robust similarity comparisons. Our preliminary work with temporal embeddings, which track the progression of clinical states, shows promise in detecting subtle disease signatures months to years before conventional diagnosis. **We hypothesize that embedding-based methods can identify characteristic disease patterns earlier than standard approaches**, enabling timely tailored interventions including molecular testing and specialist referrals that shorten the diagnostic odyssey. By comparing embedding-based patient trajectories to those of previously diagnosed individuals just before key diagnostic or interventional milestones, we will also generate prognostic insights of value for clinical decision-making. This approach is particularly critical for conditions with prolonged diagnostic delays. We will achieve these goals through the following specific aims:

**Aim 1: Develop a time-aware embedding capturing early and fluctuating signatures of disease.** We will use attention and transformer-based models to generate embeddings that capture temporal dynamics in patient trajectories. Instead of static snapshots, we will embed entire clinical histories to detect subtle onset patterns, enabling earlier disease identification and capturing signatures present only at specific, fluctuating symptom timepoints. To achieve this, we will harmonize structured (labs, diagnoses, prescriptions) and unstructured (clinical notes) data into a unified framework, integrating molecular data where available. Model outputs will be compared to diagnostic timelines to quantify early disease signatures, with attention-weighted or feature-based methods identifying critical timepoints and features. 

**Aim 2: Evaluate diagnostic acceleration using synthetic and real-world data.** We will assess whether our early disease signatures approach accelerates diagnosis relative to standard care. We will perform *in silico* simulations using synthetic EHR data generated via generative models to stress-test our system under varying data complexities and quality, and conduct retrospective analyses on real-world EHR datasets. We will compare undiagnosed patient trajectories to pre-diagnostic patterns of previously diagnosed patients, using a similarity-based algorithm in the embedding space to identify those most likely to benefit from tailored interventions. Evaluation metrics will cover technical performance and clinical interpretability across diverse settings, including specialty group meetings focused on complex, diagnostically challenging diseases, including rheumatologic, post-viral, and rare genetic conditions at UAB. It will also be evaluated in research settings across the southeast to assess its broader applicability across diverse environments.

**Aim 3: Conduct a feasibility study of an interpretable Platform for patient trajectory analysis and intervention impact.** We will develop a system that provides detailed insights on patients with similar embedding trajectories, including interventions such as specialist referrals, molecular testing, and targeted therapies, and evaluate how these interventions affect outcomes. This system will help clinicians explore intervention pathways and identify effective strategies. An explainable model will highlight the key features driving patient similarity and intervention success. Feedback from our clinician committee, across diverse settings (e.g., UAB main vs. outlying sites), will guide assessments of usability, clarity, and impact on diagnostic delays. Using an implementation science framework, we will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, sustainability, and potential biases.

**IMPACT**  
By leveraging rich, longitudinal patient data from diverse sources, our embedding-based approach will detect atypical or subtle early disease presentations often missed in routine care. This will enable earlier tailored interventions such as specialist referrals, complex testing, and altered monitoring, months to years before conventional approaches. By bridging the gap between data generation and actionable insights, this scalable, interpretable framework will be applicable across the CTSA network and real-world healthcare settings.

**RESEARCH STRATEGY**

**A. Background and Significance:**

**A.1 Introduction:**  
Despite advances in genomic testing and precision medicine, patients with complex, atypical, or rare diseases often experience prolonged **diagnostic odysseys**, marked by inconclusive evaluations, missed diagnoses, and ineffective treatments (see **Figure 1**). These conditions often present with **nonspecific or episodic symptoms**, making it challenging to recognize early signals and appropriately triage care. In both primary and specialty care, diagnostic accuracy relies on clinician expertise and pattern recognition, yet these are often insufficient for complex conditions. The resulting delays contribute to fragmented care, delayed diagnosis, unnecessary, non optimal, or exacerbating treatments, increased healthcare costs, and suboptimal patient outcomes.

### **A.2 Clinical Challenges:**

Diagnosing complex conditions is challenging due to overlapping symptoms, evolving presentations, and static data reliance, which obscure disease progression and delay timely intervention:

* ### **Symptom Variability:** Conditions like ME/CFS, POTS, and immune-mediated conditions often present with broad, nonspecific, and overlapping symptoms, complicating early recognition. The evolving and episodic nature of these conditions can mislead clinicians into attributing symptoms to more common or less severe conditions. Without systematic methods to analyze clinical histories and recognize nuanced patterns, even experienced specialists may struggle to differentiate between distinct conditions with similar presentations, leading to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis.

* ### **Prognostic Uncertainty:** Similar symptoms can arise from different underlying conditions, complicating diagnostic and treatment decisions. Limited predictive models hinder accurate prognostic assessments, leading to inconsistent outcomes, some patients respond well to treatment, while others experience chronic or relapsing symptoms. This variability undermines clinical decision-making, particularly for conditions lacking clear biomarkers.

* ### **Early Signal Detection:** Many immune, neurodegenerative, and metabolic disorders exhibit early molecular, immune, or clinical markers that often go unnoticed due to diagnostic criteria focused on advanced disease states. Periodic symptoms further complicate detection, as transient abnormalities may be overlooked in routine evaluations, delaying intervention and allowing progression to irreversible stages, reducing treatment efficacy, and increasing the risk of chronic disability.

* ### **Static Data Analysis:** Traditional diagnostic models often rely on static, isolated clinical snapshots rather than analyzing the dynamic evolution of disease trajectories. These models often focus on single points in time, missing critical trends in symptom progression, lab value fluctuations, and response to previous treatments. As a result, opportunities to detect subtle changes indicating disease onset or progression are often lost, delaying timely interventions and hindering personalized care strategies.

* ### **Data Overload:** Clinicians are increasingly required to synthesize large amounts of heterogeneous data, including clinical notes, lab results, imaging studies, and molecular findings. The manual review of such diverse datasets is time-consuming and prone to oversight, particularly when complex conditions evolve over extended periods. Without advanced analytics to support data integration and interpretation, critical patterns may remain hidden, impacting diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

### 

### **A.3 Systemic Barriers:**

Beyond clinical complexities, systemic barriers can further delay diagnosis and treatment for patients with complex conditions, making it difficult to recognize early disease signals, coordinate evaluations, and implement timely interventions:

* ### **Limited Specialist Access:** Patients with complex conditions often struggle to access specialized expertise, particularly in non-specialty settings. This gap can lead to mismanagement, with generalists relying on symptom-based treatments instead of targeted interventions. Financial and logistical barriers further limit access, leading to missed or delayed diagnoses and worsening outcomes.

* ### **Resource Constraints:** Outside major medical centers, clinicians can lack access to advanced diagnostics, specialized expertise, and comprehensive decision-support tools. These constraints limit the ability of frontline healthcare providers to recognize early disease signals and initiate appropriate referrals. Resource limitations, including time, access to integrated data systems, and advanced molecular testing capabilities, reduce diagnostic accuracy, particularly for rare or complex conditions.

* ### **Fragmented Care Pathways:** Patients with complex or undiagnosed conditions are frequently referred across multiple specialties, leading to fragmented care and diagnostic delays. Each specialty may focus on a narrow aspect of the patient's presentation, without a unified approach to synthesizing information. This siloed approach increases the need for repeated testing, redundant evaluations, and a prolonged diagnostic odyssey, driving up healthcare costs and delaying access to effective treatments.

**A.4. Embedding-Based Approach:**  
Embedding-based approaches leverage advanced machine learning techniques, including transformers and large-scale language models, to analyze complex, high-dimensional clinical data. Unlike traditional models that rely on static, point-in-time assessments, embedding models capture the dynamic progression of clinical features over time. These temporally structured embeddings transform patient data into numerical representations that reflect evolving clinical states, enabling robust pattern recognition, early signal detection, and predictive analytics.   
By encoding sequential patterns and relationships within longitudinal datasets, embedding models can reveal trends, anomalies, and subtle signals that may not be evident through conventional analysis methods. These can address the critical challenges and barriers above by assisting with:

* **Dynamic Disease Detection:** Temporal embeddings continuously analyze the evolution of clinical features, capturing subtle and progressive changes in symptoms, biomarkers, and treatment responses. Unlike traditional models that assess isolated clinical snapshots, this dynamic approach enables the identification of early disease signals and evolving patterns, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and supporting proactive clinical decision-making. Embedding techniques have been used to help diagnose patients using electronic health records (ref).   
* **Early Risk Signal Identification:** By examining temporal trends and historical clinical data, temporal analysis can detect early molecular, immune, or clinical signals that precede overt disease manifestations. This early identification of at-risk patients allows for timely specialist referrals, initiation of targeted diagnostics, and the implementation of preventive or early therapeutic strategies, potentially altering the disease trajectory.  
* **Pattern-Based Patient Matching:** Embedding models compare entire clinical trajectories rather than isolated data points, allowing for precise patient matching based on longitudinal patterns. This approach uncovers shared disease mechanisms and phenotypic similarities that may not be apparent through traditional methods, supporting personalized care plans and highlighting potential treatment pathways based on similar historical cases. In infectious disease research, temporal embeddings have helped detect patterns associated with evolution of subtypes and disease states (ref).   
* **Prognostic and Therapeutic Insight Generation:** Temporal embeddings offer prognostic capabilities by comparing individual patient trajectories with those of previously diagnosed patients who share similar clinical patterns. This comparison generates predictive insights into disease progression, likely outcomes, and expected responses to treatment, enabling clinicians to tailor interventions based on real-world evidence and improve patient management. In oncology, embedding-based models have been used to analyze EHRs and genomic data to predict patient survival and optimize personalized treatment plans (ref).

**A.5. Potential to Transform Clinical & Translational Science**  
Reducing the diagnostic odyssey for complex patients has broad benefits, including more timely treatment, lower healthcare costs, and accelerated discoveries including identifying genotype-phenotype correlations and novel biomarkers. Embedding-driven methods offer an effective, scalable approach to systematically detect patient similarities and trajectories, integrate molecular and clinical markers, and refine diagnostic pathways. By facilitating robust pattern recognition across diverse data, these methods can uncover subtle trends that might otherwise remain hidden, ultimately enabling more precise interventions and supporting breakthrough discoveries.   
Within our UM1 hub, these methods can be tested locally and then scaled across the CTSA network to drive broader research impact. If successful, they have the potential to enhance patient stratification for research studies and inform therapeutic discovery, particularly for rare and complex conditions. This scalable, data-driven framework directly supports key CTSA program objectives by:

* **Enhancing the translation of biomedical discoveries** through embedding-based models that are capable of identifying patterns in rare and complex conditions, facilitating earlier detection, supporting definitive diagnosis and prognosis, and informing more targeted research strategies.  
* **Establishing standardized data integration and analytical methodologies** to improve harmonization of clinical and molecular datasets, fostering cross-institutional collaboration and scalability across CTSA hubs.  
* **Developing interactive platforms to enhance accessibility** by allowing researchers and clinicians to explore patient trajectories, analyze similarity patterns, and interpret model insights without requiring computational expertise.  
* **Advancing translational research** by refining predictive modeling, optimizing patient trajectory analysis, and incorporating expert feedback to improve the interpretability and research utility of AI-driven biomedical discovery in alignment with NCATS’ mission.

**A.6. Leadership and integration:**  
The BEACONS project brings together a highly experienced, already integrated, and collaborative team whose combined expertise spans data science, software engineering, computational biology, precision medicine, immunology, rheumatology, clinical genetics, and clinical informatics. The team has a proven history of collaboration on major initiatives, including UAB Center for Precision Animal Modeling (Might, Worthey, Crouse, and Korf), the UAB Undiagnosed Diseases Network (Korf, Might, Worthey, and Crouse), the ARPA-H Biomedical Data Framework (Might, Dumontier, Worthey, and Crouse), the Clinical and Translational Science Award (Kimberly, Might, Korf, and Crouse), the UAB Precision Medicine Institute (Might, Crouse, Korf, Worthey, Erdmann), and UAB Recover (Erdmann and Worthey).

**A.7. Impact:**  
By systematically identifying patients who are on a trajectory toward complex, often genetic conditions months or years earlier, our embedding-based system promises to **reduce prolonged clinical uncertainty** and the financial and emotional toll of late diagnoses. In doing so, this work directly addresses the critical translational gap of bridging EHR data to real-time clinical decisions. The anticipated outcome is a scalable, robust approach for early, data-driven detection, accelerating the course from suspicion to targeted testing, diagnosis, and therapy, for some of the most challenging patients in any health system. Our ultimate objective is to **accelerate time-to-diagnosis** for complex conditions by delivering interpretable, embedding-driven methods that integrate seamlessly with real-world healthcare workflows.

**B. INNOVATION**  
This proposal introduces key innovations:

* Unlike static embeddings, our temporal trajectory embeddings capture the timing and progression of clinical features, essential for diagnosis and prognosis. While LLMs are now commonplace and have gained attention, modeling longitudinal patient data remains novel. By mapping clinical progression, we match patients by disease evolution rather than isolated symptoms, improving detection of shared mechanisms despite phenotypic variability. Our framework shifts from static snapshots to dynamic health trajectories, enabling earlier disease detection and precise risk stratification. This enables early identification of subtle signals, timely interventions, and trajectory-based comparisons to generate prognostic insights and guide tailored treatments.  
* Our approach embeds interpretability from the outset, overcoming a key barrier to AI adoption in clinical practice. By using attention layers and explainable AI methods (e.g. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we move beyond black-box models to provide granular insights. Unlike conventional AI systems that require post hoc explanations, this method ensures interpretability is an intrinsic feature, accelerating adoption and compliance. Clinicians can identify key time points, lab values, or text mentions driving predictions, enabling real-time validation and improving trust. This innovation focuses on transparency from the onset, bridging the gap between advanced machine learning and practical, real-world healthcare applications.   
* Our approach also leverages the CTSA research network and its rich data ecosystem as a testbed to implement and validate our methods.This will enable us to evaluate scalability, accuracy, and clinical relevance in a way that traditional research studies cannot, ensuring our innovations are both scientifically robust and primed for future real-world application.

**C. APPROACH**

**C.1 Preliminary Data and Feasibility**

**Disease Subtype Classification in Diabetes:**  
We developed machine learning methods to classify Type 2 diabetes (T2D) subtypes by analyzing data from 89,875 UAB patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2019\. Hierarchical clustering based on six clinical parameters, age at diagnosis, HbA1c, BMI, HOMA2-B, HOMA2-IR, and GAD autoantibody status, identified distinct disease trajectories up to three years before formal diagnosis. Our findings replicated Scandinavian studies, confirming T2D's heterogeneity with distinct metabolic subtypes and clinical courses. Notably, Black/African American patients were more frequently classified into the severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) subgroup, linked to poorer glycemic control and higher risks of myocardial infarction and nephropathy.  
This work demonstrates that EHR data can reveal meaningful disease subtypes and predict long-term trajectories. While diabetes patients generally avoid "diagnostic odysseys" due to routine testing, our model identified disease-relevant patterns years earlier, highlighting individual progression paths and subgroups suited for targeted interventions. Applying these methods to broader contexts could enhance early recognition, reduce diagnostic uncertainty, and support precision medicine.

**High-Yield Case Identification in Rare UNdiagnosed Disease:**	  
Our work has refined evaluation, prioritization, and referral processes for undiagnosed cases from within the Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN), demonstrating that machine learning models can identify high-yield cases for molecular evaluation. Analyzing over 2,400 UDN applications, we developed a classifier that replicated expert decision-making, reducing processing time for accepted cases by up to 68%. These findings highlight the potential of advanced computational models to accelerate diagnostics, enhance early detection, and optimize resource allocation.

**Predicting Trajectories and Diagnostic Interventions in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):**  
	We developed an ontology-embedded conditional generative adversarial network (Onto-CGAN) to generate synthetic patient cohorts for modeling AML. Unlike traditional GANs limited by their training data, Onto-CGAN integrates structured disease knowledge from ontologies like the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO), producing high-fidelity synthetic records, even for diseases not present in the training set. By leveraging biomedical ontology embeddings, Onto-CGAN replicates disease-specific variable distributions, correlates patterns, and predicts patient trajectories, outperforming standard generative models. In a validation study using AML EHR data from the MIMIC database, Onto-CGAN generated synthetic cohorts that more closely matched real patient distributions and variable relationships than alternative methods. The model also effectively trained machine learning classifiers to recognize and classify disease patterns.  
This approach is especially valuable for rare and underrepresented conditions with sparse real-world data. This demonstrates the feasibility of *in silico* methods for evaluating diagnostic interventions and refining predictive models for early disease detection in complex conditions. It highlights our ability to generate representative synthetic datasets, enhancing training data for AI-driven diagnostics. This approach establishes a generalizable, AI-driven framework for modeling rare, underdiagnosed, complex, and data-scarce diseases.

**C.2 APPROACH**  
We will implement our approach over three Specific Aims, each tied to milestones and evaluation metrics (see also the attached Milestones table in the “Program Milestones” document).

**Aim 1: To develop a time-aware embedding capturing early and fluctuating signatures of disease.**   
**Rationale and goals:**   
We hypothesize that embedding entire clinical trajectories (rather than static snapshots) will reveal subtle onset patterns, enabling earlier disease detection and identifying signatures present only at specific, fluctuating symptom timepoints. Conventional ML approaches rely on static input representations, masking the evolution of disease, whilst longitudinal patient embeddings (e.g., one per encounter or time window) better encode temporal change. We will refine current methodologies by leveraging attention- and transformer-based models to generate embeddings that capture each patient’s clinical state over time, embedding entire clinical trajectories to detect subtle onset patterns and enable earlier disease identification. We will harmonize diverse datasets, including structured data (labs, diagnoses, prescriptions) and unstructured clinical notes, to create a unified data framework, while also integrating available molecular data where possible. We will then compare model outputs to diagnostic timelines to quantify early disease signatures and use attention-weighted or feature-based methods to pinpoint critical timepoints and features; including identification of signatures present only in a subset of timepoints. We hypothesise that this approach will yield a validated, time-aware embedding framework significantly enhancing early diagnosis. 

**Approach:** 

* **Data Harmonization & Segmentation:** We will extract up to 5 years of EHR data, including structured elements (labs, diagnoses, prescriptions) and unstructured clinical notes, from the UM1 hub’s Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW). We will harmonize diverse terminologies to ensure data consistency and accuracy. Define temporal windows, pre-diagnostic (e.g., 5 years prior), diagnostic (6 months), and post-diagnostic (2 years), to evaluate how embeddings evolve over time. We will integrate structured data with contextual insights from clinical notes using a clinically fine-tuned language model (e.g., Clinical BERT) to enhance pattern recognition and predictive accuracy.  
* **Temporal Embedding Model:** We will develop a transformer-based or hierarchical attention model to generate visit-level embeddings, preserving timing and sequence while integrating data into a comprehensive trajectory-level representation. We will capture temporal dynamics and hierarchical relationships to improve pattern recognition. We will validate the model by comparing learned progression signatures to established diagnostic timelines in retrospective cohorts, focusing on early detection metrics such as "time gained" between the model’s first signal and the actual recorded diagnosis date.  
* **Patient Similarity Matching:** We will implement a nearest-neighbor similarity-based algorithm within the embedding space to identify patients with comparable clinical trajectories. We will evaluate both cohort-wide patterns and specific instances where patient trajectories match pre-diagnostic patterns of previously diagnosed individuals. We will compare emerging trajectories with historical cases to identify patients who may benefit from targeted diagnostics or specialist referrals.  
* **Performance & Interpretability:** We will evaluate model performance and explainability through time-dependent ROC curves, precision-recall metrics, and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). We will enhance transparency by applying SHAP or attention-weight analyses to highlight critical timepoints and clinical features driving predictions. Validation efforts will assess the model’s ability to accurately detect early disease signatures and support timely, targeted interventions.

### 

### **Diagnostic Performance & Yield**

* **Diagnostic Rate Improvement (Retrospective):** Measure the proportion of flagged patients who eventually received a confirmed diagnosis and compare it to non-flagged controls.  
* **Pre-Diagnostic Trajectory Matching:** Evaluate how well flagged patients' trajectories match pre-diagnostic patterns of previously diagnosed patients.  
* **Testing Yield (Retrospective):** Compare outcomes of molecular or specialist testing in flagged vs. unflagged historical patients.

### 

### **Model Validation & Bias Mitigation**

* **Algorithm Sensitivity & Specificity:** Assess false positives and false negatives by testing against known cases in retrospective datasets.  
* **Synthetic Patient Simulation Stress Tests:** Use generative models to evaluate system performance under varying data complexities and quality levels.  
* **Bias Detection & Correction:** Quantify disparities in flagged vs. unflagged patients across demographics and clinical variables.

### 

### **Scalability & Clinical Integration**

* **Scalability & Computational Efficiency:** Measure time and resources required for embedding and inference across different dataset sizes.  
* **Clinician Interpretability & Usability:** Evaluate how well attention-weighted or feature-based models highlight clinically meaningful insights.

**Synthetic data generation**  
We will generate realistic synthetic EHR data using generative modeling techniques, such as the Onto-CGAN (ontology-embedded GAN) pipeline, to create test cohorts with controlled “ground truth” diagnoses. This approach will allow us to simulate a wide range of diagnostic scenarios, including both straightforward cases and complex, challenging presentations with variable data completeness or missingness. 

**Expected Outcome:**  
A validated, time-aware embedding architecture capable of detecting incipient disease states and progression patterns. By merging free-text narratives with structured labs and diagnoses, we minimize reliance on perfect data standardization. If successful, our approach will be adaptable across health systems with variable data practices.

**Potential Pitfalls & Alternatives:**  
One potential challenge is the heterogeneity of clinical notes, as variation in provider documentation styles and institutional practices can introduce inconsistencies in text-based analyses. To mitigate this, we will standardize key vocabulary terms and implement domain-specific text embedding layers, ensuring that critical clinical details are consistently captured across different sites. Another potential challenge is sparse data, which can limit model training and validation. If initial data processing reveals this issue, we will focus on conditions with moderate diagnostic frequency at our UM1 site to ensure robust sample sizes. Additionally, we will employ data augmentation techniques, such as synthetic data generation using models like Onto-CGAN, to supplement rare condition datasets. We will also explore external collaborations within the CTSA network to access broader datasets, enhancing model training and generalizability. These strategies will enhance the reliability and interpretability of our models, reducing bias and improving performance in real-world settings.

**Aim 2: Evaluate embedding model insight acceleration using ARC Platform.**   
**Rationale and goals:**   
The goal of this aim is to develop and evaluate the ARC platform, an interactive research tool designed to facilitate visualization, exploration, and validation of BEACONS model insights for patient similarity mapping, trajectory analysis, and predictive comparisons. The platform will enable investigators to assess the strength and relevance of early disease signatures and evaluate whether embedding-based approaches have the potential to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy.  
To achieve this, we will develop structured case-based visualizations that integrate patient similarity mappings, dynamic trajectory comparisons, and predictive analytics. The ARC platform will feature an interactive user interface, allowing our expert users to explore matched patient trajectories, analyze divergences in disease progression, and assess the impact of specific data features for cases on predictive outcomes. Explainability and interpretability will be central to this framework, incorporating SHAP-based feature importance analyses to highlight key data points driving predictions. Additionally, we will conduct systematic stress testing using synthetic EHR data, introducing controlled variations in data complexity, completeness, and uncertainty to assess model robustness. This process will ensure the platform remains effective across a range of clinical scenarios and data quality conditions.  
By developing a visual, interactive, and explainable system, this aim will produce a research-driven platform for identifying clinically meaningful patterns, validating predictive insights, and refining diagnostic and prognostic pathways. The ARC platform will serve as a critical bridge between embedding based models accessible to data scientists and expert clinical reasoning, fostering deeper understanding, hypothesis generation, and translational impact in complex disease research.

**Approach:**  
*Platform Technology:*  
The ARC Platform will be designed to present embedding model generated insights within a robust, scalable architecture. At its core, the platform leverages Docker Swarm for container orchestration, ensuring efficient deployment and management of modular services (Figure xx). The backend processing pipeline, built using FastAPI and Uvicorn, supports real-time data processing and interaction, with LangChain enabling AI-driven reasoning and analysis. The data layer incorporates MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, and ElasticSearch, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and indexing of patient similarity mappings, trajectory analyses, and predictive insights. Additionally, OpenAI, Ollama, and Neo4j provide AI-enhanced data interpretation and graph-based relational insights to map patient trajectories.  
For workflow automation, SnakeMake and Nextflow support scalable computational workflows, allowing for complex data processing pipelines such as SHAP-based feature importance analysis. The system runs on high-performance computing clusters, Microsoft Azure, and A100 GPUs, providing the computational power needed to process large-scale EHR datasets efficiently. The VueJS-based front-end ensures an intuitive and interactive interface for experts to explore case-based visualizations, trajectory comparisons, and model-predicted outcomes.

*Case Information:*  
The ARC platform will present case-specific information through structured summaries, tables, graphs, and interactive maps to enable rapid review of patient histories. Key data such as diagnoses, test results, treatments, and referrals, will be aggregated into a centralized summary view, with interactive elements allowing our expert users to drill down to specific data points. Tabular representations will provide a structured view of encounters, while trend graphs will illustrate key laboratory values, vitals, or other time-sensitive measures. 

*Case Similarity Mapping:*  
To support patient similarity assessments, the platform will incorporate embedding-based similarity visualizations, leveraging distance metrics such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Cases will be displayed as nodes within an interactive similarity network, where the spatial proximity of cases reflects their relatedness across embeddings. Our expert users will be able to review to facilitate hypothesis generation and exploration of disease phenotypes that share common clinical, genetic, or prognostic characteristics.

*Patient Trajectories:*  
The ARC platform will present chronologically organized patient trajectories, mapping events, including clinic visits, diagnoses, test results, referrals, and treatments, in a structured timeline format. Our expert users will be able to toggle between coarse-grained (high-level summaries) and fine-grained (individual events) representations to explore disease progression. This temporal arrangement of data allows experts to assess patterns such as onset, occurrence, and treatment impact. Interactive controls will enable zooming in on specific periods of interest, supporting deeper understanding of patient history in relation to decision points. To facilitate comparative analysis, the platform will support overlaying of multiple patient trajectories on a standardized timeline with shared x-axis scale, enabling review of variation in disease progression and symptoms across cases. The ARC Platform will also support alignment of patient trajectories based on diagnosis date, symptom onset, or other key event, normalizing comparisons across patients with heterogeneous trajectories. This feature will highlight divergences in disease course, treatment response, and long-term outcomes, offering insights into factors contributing to variability in prognosis.

*Identifying Individuals Most Likely to Benefit from Alternative Interventions:*  
The ARC platform facilitates identification of individuals who may benefit from nonstandard diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, such as advanced molecular testing or earlier specialist referrals. By leveraging embedding-based similarity scores and condition-specific thresholds, we can identify cases in which an earlier or alternative intervention altered trajectory. Patients whose clinical, genetic, or prognostic profiles resemble known responders to these interventions will be flagged for review. This functionality supports research-driven refinement of care pathways in complex and diagnostically challenging conditions, allowing clinicians and investigators to target interventions more effectively and reduce diagnostic delays.

*Highlighting Features Driving Similarity and Trajectory Matching:*  
The ARC platform will incorporate precomputed SHAP values and attention-based feature importance scores, allowing our expert to identify and explore the data features driving patient similarity and/or trajectory alignment. Identifying the specific  lab values, symptoms, test results, or interventions influencing insights in this way will allow judgement on whether our model generated insights make sense. Users will be able to examine why specific cases were matched or why certain trajectories diverge, with visually annotated indicators making these relationships clear. 

*Interactive Feature Manipulation:*  
Users will be able to flag particular data features for removal, or add additional data points such as specific test results or interventions, in order to observe how these changes alter patterns and trajectories. While these modifications will not update the model in real time, they will trigger an asynchronous recalculation, producing revised outputs alongside the originals for comparative analysis in subsequent review. This functionality enables experts to explore counterfactual scenarios, evaluating how different actions, such as earlier referrals, alternative treatment strategies, or expanded testing, seem to have influenced disease onset or progression. By allowing iterative hypothesis testing, this feature will support deeper insights into disease mechanisms, intervention timing, and treatment strategies, refining the model’s applicability.

*Testing:*  
We will rigorously stress-test ARC platform robustness by systematically varying data complexity, including the presence or absence of hallmark symptoms, incomplete records, and ambiguous clinical presentations. This approach will assess the platform’s ability to accurately identify disease subtypes and early signals across a range of diagnostic challenges, ensuring reliability in real-world, heterogeneous data environments. We will perform UAT and usability testing with dry-run evaluations, expert feedback loops, and performance assessments to refine usability, accuracy, and scalability. We will assess false-positive and false-negative rates, sensitivity, and specificity using retrospective synthetic cases modeled after late- and missed-diagnosis cohorts to determine whether the platform detects early signals and distinguishes clinically similar but etiologically distinct conditions. Results will guide refinements to the embedding model, similarity metrics, and prediction thresholds. Findings from dry runs, usability testing, and validation studies will inform final optimizations before broader deployment and testing as outlined in Aim 3\. 

**Expected Outcome:**  
This aim will establish a framework for leveraging patient trajectory embeddings to enhance early identification, risk stratification, and decision-making. We will refine methods to match undiagnosed patients to prior cases based on clinical similarity and disease progression patterns, enabling precise identification of those likely to benefit from alternative diagnostic pathways, such as specialty consultation, advanced molecular testing, or targeted interventions. By analyzing shared features and trajectories across matched patients, we will generate predictive insights to help clinicians anticipate worsening symptoms, tailor management strategies, and optimize outcomes. A structured decision-support framework, integrating similarity-based algorithms and condition-specific thresholding, will indicate when a patient's evolving clinical profile suggests the need for diagnostic reevaluation or early intervention.  
This approach will also identify comparable patient cohorts, generating prognostic information based on real-world disease trajectories and prior treatment responses. Ultimately, this work will translate embedding-based disease pattern recognition into a scalable, interpretable platform that enhances clinical triage, accelerates diagnosis, and informs personalized patient management.

**Potential Pitfalls & Alternatives:**  
The effectiveness of similarity-based patient matching relies on accurate trajectory embeddings and robust comparison metrics. To address phenotype variability and incomplete data, we will refine multi-modal embeddings that integrate structured (labs, diagnoses) and unstructured (clinical notes) data, prioritizing clinically meaningful overlaps over superficial similarities. To enhance predictive accuracy amid variability in disease course and treatment response, we will implement temporal weighting to emphasize the most informative progression features, validated against real-world outcomes. Sensitivity analyses will assess robustness across diverse populations and disease subtypes. To ensure clinical actionability, an explanation layer will highlight key clinical events, lab values, or patterns driving matches or predicted trajectory shifts, promoting clinician trust and usability. 

**Aim 3: Evaluating Research Utility of Temporal Embeddings and the ARC Platform**  
**Rationale and goals:**   
In this aim, we will transition our embedding-driven ARC platform from development to targeted evaluation by introducing it in existing focused research meetings attended by clinical and research experts. Deployment into a carefully managed setting will allow us to gather structured feedback on the platform's predictive insights, usability, and potential research value, ensuring a thorough assessment before broader application. The primary goal of these activities is to rigorously evaluate the ARC Platform as a research tool for identifying diagnostic and prognostic patterns in complex diseases. By engaging clinicians, researchers, and informatics experts across different settings, these meetings will gather structured feedback on the platform’s insights, usability, and potential research impact. The meetings will assess how well the platform aligns with clinical reasoning, whether it provides novel and actionable insights, and how it can be improved before broader research or clinical applications.

**Approach:**  
As the project transitions from internal validation to external evaluation, we will engage experts (Figure x) in systematic analysis of BEACON generated diagnostic and prognostic insights served up through the ARC Platform. In order to ensure compliance with privacy standards, these insights will be generated using fully synthetic patient records produced as we have previously demonstrated (ref). Review meetings, modeled after variant or case reviews, will begin with a detailed case presentation followed by discussion of model predictions and clinical insights. This structured approach will ensure a focused, productive session where experts can critically evaluate the correctness and utility of embedding generated insights as well as the ARC Platform’s utility as a research tool in presenting data and insights. These meetings will generate valuable insights for further refinement.  
This ARC platform evaluation process will proceed through four structured phases, each composed of recurring sessions designed to support growth and allow progressive broadening of the scope of expert engagement (Figure xx). These are: 1\) ARC technical team meetings for review of functionality. 2\) Core BEACONS team for initial clinical utility assessment and refinement. 3\) Existing case review meetings of UAB specialty groups for careful evaluation of utilisation for different clinical settings. 4\) Introduction at CTSA regional network meetings for engagement and review external to UAB. 

**Specialty Group Evaluations:**

**Model insight and ARC Platform evaluation:**  
To ensure objective assessment and track progress, we will evaluate the following key areas:

#### *Insight validation*

* **Alignment with experts insights:** Percentage of cases where experts confirm that the platform’s patient similarity matching is accurate and clinically meaningful.  
* **Detection of previously unrecognized patterns:** Identification of instances where the platform reveals novel diagnostic or prognostic trajectories, particularly in late- or missed-diagnosis cases.  
* **Perceived utility:** Qualitative feedback on whether insights align with expert reasoning and whether early detection signals could influence diagnostic decisions or intervention timing.

* **Scalability and sustainability:** Evaluation of the platform’s adaptability across varying levels of clinical and research infrastructure, ensuring long-term feasibility within CTSA-affiliated institutions.


*Retrospective Validation on Real EHR Cohorts:* 

*Protocol for prospective deployment:*  
Based on the findings from synthetic data analyses within the platform, we will develop a protocol for prospective deployment of the BEACONS platform, outlining recommended thresholds, inclusion criteria, and potential clinical and operational endpoints such as cost savings and time to definitive therapy. By leveraging insights from simulation outcomes, we will create detailed next-step protocols for real-world prospective testing, laying the groundwork for subsequent activities. This final step will bridge our RC2 demonstration project to broader implementation, positioning the platform for future multi-site adoption within the CTSA network. 

**Expected Outcome:**  
We expect a rigorous evaluation of our embedding-based early detection platform to demonstrate quantitative improvements in diagnostic speed and accuracy. This evaluation will provide robust evidence of the platform’s feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility, testing its potential to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient triage for rare and complex diseases.  
Ultimately, the ARC platform displaying BEACON insights will support earlier, more accurate diagnoses and empower clinicians to make informed, data-driven decisions. By delivering a clear, dynamic representation of complex data, it aims to reduce diagnostic uncertainty, enhance personalized treatment strategies, and improve patient outcomes across diverse clinical settings.  
By validating our implementation science framework, we will identify critical enablers and barriers to adoption, ensuring that the tool is not only effective but also sustainable and adaptable in diverse clinical settings. These outcomes will build a strong foundation for prospective trials and real-world deployment, with the long-term goal of transforming clinical workflows and enhancing early recognition, personalized treatment, and outcomes in rare and complex disease management.

**Potential Pitfalls & Alternatives:**  
Diagnostic pathways vary widely across institutions and specialties, potentially limiting the system’s generalizability in diverse clinical settings. To address this challenge, we will test the platform in multiple clinical domains, including rheumatology, Long COVID, and rare disease networks, allowing iterative refinement to enhance adaptability aiming for broad clinical relevance.   
Maintaining authenticity in synthetic data is another potential pitfall, as it is crucial that synthetic data generated for *in silico* evaluations accurately reflect real-world clinical patterns. To mitigate this risk, we will calibrate generative models to preserve realistic patterns, such as correlations among laboratory measures, and validate synthetic patterns against real local data to ensure plausibility and reliability.   
Finally, limited data availability for rare conditions could hinder robust evaluation and model training. To overcome this obstacle, we will focus on conditions with sufficient local volume and establish partnerships with external CTSA sites to expand data access, strengthening the robustness and generalizability of our evaluations.

**Impact and Significance:**  
We believe that application of the methods we outline here has the potential to transform the diagnostic and prognostic landscape for complex and difficult-to-recognize conditions. By leveraging advanced temporal embeddings, our platform is designed to capture the timing, progression, and periodicity of clinical features, enabling earlier identification of at-risk patients and supporting timely, targeted interventions to improve outcomes. By analyzing dynamic health trajectories, we believe that BEACONS will be well suited to detection of periodic or transient abnormalities, matching patients with similar clinical and molecular profiles, and identification of effective interventions based on comparison against real-world outcomes for similar patients. By comparing patient trajectories to those of previously diagnosed individuals, our system may provide predictive analytics that help clinicians anticipate disease progression and optimize treatment strategies. We expect to demonstrate measurable improvements in diagnostic speed, accuracy, and prognostic precision.   
If successful, this approach should be able to reduce trial-and-error treatment, enhance evidence-based decision-making, and support personalized care. This approach represents a scalable, adaptable framework aligned with NCATS and NIH priorities, enhancing diagnostic precision and clinical efficiency across diverse healthcare settings. Ultimately, our approach will have utility for patients with both complex or rare conditions ensuring that they can receive the right care at the right time, reducing healthcare inefficiencies, lowering costs, and setting a new benchmark for translational research and clinical practice.   
In summary, this proposal harnesses the transformative power of temporal embeddings to address a pervasive challenge: the costly, protracted diagnostic odyssey faced by patients with complex, rare, or atypical conditions. By unifying data across multiple modalities, identifying high-yield moments for molecular testing, and rigorously evaluating performance through in silico and retrospective analyses, we will establish a foundation for next-generation precision diagnostics that can be rapidly extended across the CTSA network.
