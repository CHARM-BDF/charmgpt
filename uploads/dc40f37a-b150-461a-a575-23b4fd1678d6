The professional genetics workforce, including medical geneticists and genetic counselors, is relatively small and is unlikely to grow in proportion with the volume of genomic tests ordered (Maiese 2019, Dragojlovic et al 2020, Hoskovec et al 2018). Effective result communication is critically important to those found to be at risk of a genetic condition and is also important for those found not to have an identifiable genetic risk to avoid false reassurance. The premise of this proposal is that scalable approaches to providing information to patients about genetic and genomic testing are needed and that generative artificial intelligence (AI) may, when carefully designed with due attention to ethics of trust and equity, provide one such approach. For the past seven years we have been conducting a genomic medicine implementation science initiative funded by the state of Alabama called the &ldquo;Alabama Genomic Health Initiative (AGHI).&rdquo; Research participants have genotyping and return of pathogenic or likely pathogenic results in the most current ACMG secondary findings list. Participants also complete a questionnaire regarding family history.&nbsp; Pathogenic or likely pathogenic results are returned by phone by a genetic counselor and participants are referred for further medical evaluation. Those without returnable results receive a mailed letter explaining the outcome and limitations of testing. Family history information is reviewed by a team of genetic counselors with concerning findings highlighted in the AGHI result report along with a recommendation to consider additional genetic counseling and testing. We propose here to utilize the AGHI platform to test a prototype of an AI-based approach to initial return of results and to test whether it is superior to our current methods of returning these results:</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Aim 1: Refine an existing prototype of an AI-based return of results system for the communication of genomic screening results.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp; The current prototype, GeneWise, leverages multi-modal large language models to provide an encrypted, mobile- and desktop-friendly web chat session that simulates human genetic counseling. Under the proposed effort, GeneWise will be enhanced to securely deliver results to participants and store conversation transcripts for review by certified genetic counselors. A multi-faceted testing approach involving technical evaluations, user-experience (UX) assessments and engagement with community and professional stakeholders will be employed to ensure the system's robustness, cultural sensitivity and effectiveness in communicating complex genetic information to diverse populations and educational backgrounds (Aim 1a).&nbsp; Input from a community advisory board and professional advisory group will be gathered throughout the study through deliberative discussion focus groups (Aim 1b).</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Aim 2: Evaluate the refined AI-based result communication tool in the AGHI environment.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"> A superiority trial will be conducted to determine whether supplementation with an AI-based approach to result communication is superior to a written report alone for participants with negative results both with (Aim 2a) and without (Aim 2b) concerning family history. All positive disease risk results will be communicated through GeneWise to maximize exploratory data collection (Aim 2c). Participant surveys will assess personal utility of genomic screening results, perceived baseline and residual disease risk, and result recall. The personal utility scale (PrU) will be used as the primary outcome for superiority trials. Genetic counselors will review AI tool interactions to monitor for safety and tool refinement.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">AIm 3:&nbsp; Qualitatively examine experiences with and attitudes toward return of genomic results by an interactive generative AI tool.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"> We will conduct semi-structured interviews with individuals who have received results from genomic testing via GeneWise.
