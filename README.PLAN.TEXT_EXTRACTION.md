# Text Extraction Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add capability to extract text from various file types (PDF, Word, etc.) during upload, making the content accessible to LLMs for chat interactions.

## Phase 1: Setup and Basic Infrastructure
1. Add necessary dependencies
   - `pdf-parse` for PDF files
   - `mammoth` for Word documents
   - Consider `textract` for broader file type support

2. Update FileMetadata type to include extracted text
   ```typescript
   interface FileMetadata {
     // ... existing fields ...
     extractedText?: string;
     originalFormat: string;
     textExtractionStatus: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed';
     textExtractionError?: string;
   }
   ```

## Phase 2: Text Extraction Implementation
1. Create text extraction service
   - Implement handlers for different file types
   - Add error handling
   - Add progress tracking for large files

2. Modify file upload process
   - Detect file type
   - Route to appropriate extractor
   - Store both original file and extracted text
   - Update UI to show extraction progress

3. Test with various file types and sizes
   - Small/large PDFs
   - Word documents with different formatting
   - Error cases (corrupted files, unsupported formats)

## Phase 3: LLM Integration
1. Update chat interface to access extracted text
   - Add ability to reference uploaded files in chat
   - Handle cases where text extraction failed
   - Consider chunking for large texts

2. Add text preview/validation
   - Allow users to verify extracted text
   - Provide editing capability for corrections
   - Show extraction quality warnings if needed

## Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements
1. Add progress indicators
   - Show extraction status in file list
   - Add warning icons for failed extractions
   - Show processing state during upload

2. Improve error handling
   - Clear error messages for users
   - Retry options for failed extractions
   - Fallback options for unsupported formats

## Implementation Order
1. Start with Phase 1 - infrastructure changes
2. Implement PDF support first (most common use case)
3. Add Word document support
4. Implement UI improvements incrementally
5. Add additional file type support based on needs

## Considerations
- Large file handling
- Memory usage during extraction
- Error recovery
- User feedback
- Storage implications
- Performance impact

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Text successfully extracted from PDFs and Word docs
- [ ] Extracted text available in chat context
- [ ] Clear error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] Reliable extraction from various file formats

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional file types
- OCR for scanned documents
- Better handling of document structure
- Improved text cleaning and formatting
- Automatic summarization of extracted text
