Yes, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) TypeScript SDK facilitates logging by providing a standardized mechanism for servers to send structured log messages to clients. This allows clients to control logging verbosity and receive notifications containing severity levels, logger names, and additional data. citeturn0search6

**Implementing Logging in Your MCP Server:**

1. **Declare Logging Capability:**
   Ensure your server declares the `logging` capability to indicate it supports logging functionalities.

   ```typescript
   const server = new McpServer({
     name: "My MCP Server",
     version: "1.0.0",
     capabilities: {
       logging: {}
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Set Up Log Level Handling:**
   Implement a handler to process `logging/setLevel` requests from clients, allowing them to set the desired log level.

   ```typescript
   server.onRequest("logging/setLevel", async (params) => {
     const { level } = params;
     // Validate and set the log level accordingly
     // For example, adjust your logging library's configuration here
   });
   ```

3. **Send Log Messages to Clients:**
   Utilize the `notifications/message` method to send log messages to connected clients. Each message should include the severity level, an optional logger name, and any relevant data.

   ```typescript
   server.notify("notifications/message", {
     level: "error",
     logger: "database",
     data: {
       error: "Connection failed",
       details: {
         host: "localhost",
         port: 5432
       }
     }
   });
   ```

**Example of Sending a Log Message:**

Here's how you might send an informational log message when a tool is invoked:

```typescript
server.tool(
  "exampleTool",
  { param: z.string() },
  async ({ param }, context) => {
    context.session.sendLogMessage("info", { message: `exampleTool invoked with param: ${param}` });
    // Tool implementation
  }
);
```

**Monitoring and Analyzing Logs:**

To effectively monitor and analyze logs from your MCP server, consider integrating with external log management services. For instance, Tinybird offers a template for MCP Server Analytics that uses TypeScript logging handlers to send events to their platform, enabling real-time log analysis and visualization. citeturn0search5
