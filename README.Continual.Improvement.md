   // Standard MCP interaction pattern
   interface MCPInteraction {
     // Input format
     request: {
       tool: string;
       params: {
         code: string;
         dataFiles?: Record<string, string>;
         timeout?: number;
       };
     };
     
     // Output format - Raw results only
     response: {
       output?: string;  // Raw output from Python
       error?: string;   // Raw error message if any

## Memory Management in Python Tests

### Issue: Memory Limit Testing Challenges
- **Problem**: Reliably enforcing and testing memory limits in Python code execution is proving difficult
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  1. Using `resource.setrlimit()` - Not consistently effective across platforms
  2. Using environment variables (`PYTHONMEMORY`) - Limited effectiveness
  3. Using memory_profiler and psutil - More accurate monitoring but not enforcing limits
  4. Using ulimit settings - Platform-dependent behavior

### Current Status (Updated 2024)
- **Decision**: Temporarily accepting memory limit test failure
- **Rationale**:
  1. Low direct security risk due to multiple other protective layers:
     - Package whitelist system
     - Dangerous operation blocking
     - File system restrictions
     - Network access controls
     - Timeout limits (30s default)
  2. System stability protected by:
     - Process-level monitoring through `psutil`
     - OS-level resource limits
     - Python environment restrictions
     - Process isolation
  3. Existing mitigations:
     - Process timeouts
     - OS-level memory management
     - Process isolation

### Risk Assessment
- **Security Impact**: LOW
  - Core security measures remain intact
  - Process isolation prevents system-wide issues
- **Stability Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM
  - Worst case: Individual process termination
  - No persistent system effects
- **Production Impact**: LOW
  - Platform-dependent behavior is documented
  - Multiple fallback protections in place

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Short-term Fix**:
   - Replace memory limit test with a more reliable resource constraint test
   - Focus on testing CPU limits or file size limits instead
   - Use process monitoring instead of hard limits

2. **Long-term Improvements**:
   - Implement a dedicated process manager for Python execution
   - Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for reliable resource limits
   - Create platform-specific memory limit implementations
   - Consider using cgroups on Linux systems

### Implementation Notes

1. **Memory Monitoring Approach**:
   ```python
   # More reliable approach using process monitoring
   import psutil
   import time
   
   def monitor_process(pid, limit_mb):
       process = psutil.Process(pid)
       while True:
           memory_mb = process.memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)
           if memory_mb > limit_mb:
               process.terminate()
           time.sleep(0.1)
   ```

2. **Container-based Approach**:
   ```yaml
   # Docker-based solution (future implementation)
   services:
     python_executor:
       image: python:3.11
       mem_limit: 256m
       memswap_limit: 256m
   ```

### Next Steps

1. Revise the current memory test to focus on process monitoring
2. Add documentation about platform-specific memory management
3. Plan for containerization in future versions
4. Consider implementing a more robust process management system

### Related Issues
- File cleanup errors in test execution
- Cross-platform compatibility challenges
- Resource limit enforcement reliability

## Test Infrastructure Improvements

### Current Challenges
1. **File Cleanup**:
   - Cleanup errors occurring during test execution
   - Need better error handling for file operations

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Inconsistent resource limit enforcement
   - Platform-dependent behavior

### Planned Improvements
1. Implement robust file cleanup mechanisms
2. Add comprehensive logging for resource usage
3. Create platform-specific test configurations
4. Enhance error reporting and handling

## Markdown Processing Issues

### Heading Marker Processing
**Context:**
- Component: AssistantMarkdown.tsx
- Issue: Single # heading markers (h1) were not being processed correctly while ## (h2) and ### (h3) worked fine
- Environment: React component using react-markdown

**Problem:**
- Heading markers were being wrapped in quotes and divs during XML content processing
- This prevented the markdown parser from recognizing them as proper heading elements
- Resulted in h1 headings being rendered as plain text within divs

**Solution:**
1. Remove quotes around heading markers during preprocessing:
```typescript
const headingProcessed = artifactProcessed.replace(/"(#+\s[^"]+)"/g, '$1');
```

2. Prevent wrapping heading sections in divs:
```typescript
if (section.trim().match(/^#+\s/)) {
  return section;
}
```

**Prevention:**
- When processing markdown content that includes XML or HTML:
  1. Ensure markdown syntax elements aren't wrapped in HTML elements
  2. Remove any quotes that might be added during processing
  3. Keep markdown syntax at the root level of the content
  4. Test all heading levels (h1, h2, h3) when making changes to markdown processing

**Related Scenarios:**
- Similar issues might occur with other markdown syntax elements if they get wrapped in HTML
- Watch for inconsistent behavior between different markdown elements
- Pay attention to XML/HTML processing that might interfere with markdown syntax
