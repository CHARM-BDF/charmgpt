### Python Integration Planning - [2024-02-04]
Tags: integration, python, documentation, planning

#### Context
- System State: Initial Python integration planning phase
- Configuration: Multiple documentation files and implementation plans
- Environment: Node.js with TypeScript, planning Python integration
- Requirements: Need to integrate Python runtime with MCP system

#### Problem Description
- Challenge: Managing multiple documentation files while planning Python integration
- Impact: Risk of scattered information and duplicate efforts
- Potential Issues: Documentation overlap, version conflicts, missing requirements

#### Investigation
- Debug Process: Reviewed all documentation files
- Tools Used: File system search, documentation analysis
- Key Insights: 
  - Found comprehensive Python plan in README.General.Python.Plan.md
  - Multiple documentation files with overlapping information
  - Need for focused documentation strategy

#### Solution
- Implementation:
  1. Identified core documentation files needed for Python integration
  2. Separated concerns between general documentation and Python-specific docs
  3. Established clear documentation hierarchy
- Why It Works:
  - Reduces cognitive load during implementation
  - Prevents documentation fragmentation
  - Maintains clear focus on current implementation goals

#### Prevention
- Warning Signs:
  - Multiple files covering the same topics
  - Difficulty finding specific implementation details
  - Inconsistent information across documents
- Best Practices:
  1. Keep implementation-specific documentation separate
  2. Cross-reference related documents
  3. Update Continual Improvement doc with lessons learned
  4. Maintain clear documentation hierarchy
- Related Scenarios:
  - New feature integration planning
  - Cross-cutting concern implementation
  - System architecture changes
- Future Considerations:
  - Document versioning strategy
  - Integration test documentation
  - Performance monitoring documentation

## Environment Setup Requirements

### API Keys
1. **Anthropic API Key**
   - Required for file analysis feature
   - Must be set in `.env` file as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here`
   - Error if missing: "Could not resolve authentication method. Expected either apiKey or authToken to be set."

## Common Issues and Solutions

### File Analysis
1. **Issue**: File analysis fails with authentication error
   - **Symptom**: 500 error with message about Anthropic API authentication
   - **Solution**: Ensure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in .env file
   - **Verification**: Server logs will show "Anthropic API Key present: true" on startup

2. **File Path Resolution**
   - **Issue**: File content cannot be read during analysis
   - **Solution**: Use the stored file path from metadata
   - **Verification**: Check server logs for file path and content reading status

## Feature Documentation

### AI File Analysis
1. **Purpose**: Generate AI-powered analysis of file contents for code generation
2. **Activation**: "Analyze with AI" button in file details modal
3. **Process**:
   - Reads first 1000 characters of file
   - Sends to Claude for analysis
   - Stores analysis in file's llmNotes field
4. **Output Structure**:
   - fileType: File type and format
   - contentSummary: Brief content description
   - keyFeatures: Important characteristics
   - recommendations: Usage suggestions

## Logging Implementation
1. **Client-side Logs**:
   - File selection events
   - Analysis attempts
   - Success/failure status
2. **Server-side Logs**:
   - File metadata access
   - Content reading status
   - API interactions
   - Error details with stack traces

## Best Practices
1. **Error Handling**:
   - Check environment variables on startup
   - Validate file paths before access
   - Provide detailed error messages
2. **Performance**:
   - Sample large files instead of full content
   - Cache metadata when possible
