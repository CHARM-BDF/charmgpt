# Multi-Provider LLM Implementation Status

## Overview
This document provides a current status update on the multi-provider LLM implementation in the MCP Server project. We've successfully integrated OpenAI and Gemini alongside the existing Claude/Anthropic provider, and made several important fixes to ensure consistent behavior across providers.

## Current Status (2025-05-06)

### What's Working

1. **Basic Chat Functionality**
   - ✅ All providers (Claude/Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini) can be selected in the UI
   - ✅ Basic chat without specialized tools works for all providers
   - ✅ Provider switching via modelProvider parameter works correctly

2. **Tool Selection & Execution**
   - ✅ Fixed OpenAI adapter to properly extract tool calls from responses
   - ✅ OpenAI now correctly selects and uses domain-specific tools (PubMed, etc.)
   - ✅ Sequential thinking process works with tool execution for all providers
   - ✅ System prompt enhanced to encourage appropriate tool usage

3. **Artifact Handling**
   - ✅ Bibliography collection and display works properly
   - ✅ Knowledge graph collection and merging implemented
   - ✅ Direct artifacts from tool results are collected and displayed
   - ✅ TypeScript errors fixed with proper type assertions
   - ✅ Unified artifact collection phase implemented in ChatService

4. **Model Selection**
   - ✅ Fixed model name conflicts when switching between providers
   - ✅ Each provider uses appropriate default models when not specified
   - ✅ Compatible model validation prevents using incorrect models with providers

### Known Issues

1. **Response Formatting**
   - ⚠️ The `/api/chat-artifacts` endpoint has formatter errors with OpenAI and Anthropic
   - ⚠️ Some specialized artifact types may not render correctly in all contexts

2. **Complex Tool Interactions**
   - ⚠️ Complex multi-step tool interactions need further testing with non-Claude providers
   - ⚠️ Error handling could be improved for edge cases in tool responses

3. **Streaming Support**
   - ⚠️ True streaming not yet implemented for all providers
   - ⚠️ Current implementation uses simulated streaming in some cases

## Implementation Highlights

1. **Adapter Pattern Success**
   - Tool call adapters effectively normalize the different formats used by each provider
   - Response formatter adapters ensure consistent output structure
   - Provider-specific quirks are properly handled and documented

2. **Artifact Handling Architecture**
   - Successfully mirrored the chat.ts implementation in ChatService
   - Using the same patterns for extending arrays with custom properties
   - Unified artifact collection phase captures all specialized data types

3. **Minimal Impact Changes**
   - Used targeted fixes that maintain existing functionality
   - Followed established codebase patterns and conventions
   - Applied the principle of making the smallest possible changes

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Formatter Issues**
   - Resolve the response formatting errors in the chat-artifacts endpoint
   - Ensure consistent rendering of all artifact types

2. **Expand Testing**
   - Test more complex scenarios across all providers
   - Validate knowledge graph and bibliography behavior in edge cases

3. **Documentation**
   - Complete documentation of provider-specific limitations
   - Create examples for using each provider effectively

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile and optimize sequential thinking process
   - Reduce redundant API calls where possible
