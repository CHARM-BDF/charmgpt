# Prompt for Implementing Natural Language MCP Integration

I need help implementing natural language command detection for MCP (Model Context Protocol) in a TypeScript/React application. I have three key documents to provide context:

1. `README.MCP.HOWTO.md` - Core MCP architecture and implementation details
2. `README.MCP.plan.md` - The phased implementation plan for MCP integration
3. `README.MCP.summary2.md` - Natural language integration summary and data flow

## Current State

- The application has a working chat interface with an LLM
- Basic MCP integration is implemented with explicit command handling (e.g., `/tool name --arg value`)
- MCP servers can be connected and tools are accessible

## Goal

Add the ability for the LLM to automatically detect when to use MCP tools based on natural language queries, without requiring explicit command syntax.

## Required Capabilities

1. Tool registration with the LLM
2. Natural language intent detection
3. Parameter extraction from natural queries
4. Seamless integration with existing chat flow

## Questions to Address

1. How should we modify the existing chat component to support natural language MCP integration?
2. What changes are needed in the MCP client to support automatic tool detection?
3. How can we ensure proper error handling and fallbacks?
4. What's the best way to test this implementation?

Please help me:

1. Review the provided documentation
2. Create a detailed implementation plan
3. Identify any potential issues or considerations
4. Provide code examples for key components
5. Suggest testing strategies

When providing code examples, please use TypeScript and follow React best practices. Security and error handling should be primary considerations.
