# Enhanced User Message Handling Plan
**Created:** May 12, 2025
**Purpose:** Address issues in the message handling pipeline where valuable content is correctly generated but not properly presented to the user.

## Background

The current implementation has shown a critical issue where the system successfully gathers and processes information (as seen in the PubMed search results for cancer papers), but fails to present this information to the user. Instead, it incorrectly responds with a generic message about not being able to access external databases, despite having already retrieved the data.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Message Processing Pipeline Enhancement

#### A. Data Flow Tracking
- Implement explicit state tracking for each stage of message processing
- Add metadata flags to indicate content status (new vs. previously shown)
- Create clear separation between data gathering and presentation phases

#### B. Response Formatter Update
```typescript
interface FormatterInput {
  originalMessage: string;
  gatheredData: any[];
  processingStatus: {
    isNewContent: boolean;
    dataSource: string;
    timestamp: number;
  };
}
```

### 2. System Prompt Refinement

#### A. Data Gathering Phase
```typescript
const dataGatheringPrompt = `
You are an AI assistant focused on gathering information.
1. Use available tools to collect relevant data
2. Mark data gathering as complete when sufficient
3. Do not attempt to answer the question directly
4. Track what data has been gathered
`;
```

#### B. Analysis Phase
```typescript
const analysisPrompt = `
You are an AI assistant analyzing gathered information.
1. Process only the data that has been gathered
2. Create comprehensive summaries
3. Mark content as new for user presentation
4. Ensure all relevant details are included
`;
```

### 3. Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Core Pipeline Updates**
   - Implement state tracking
   - Update formatter logic
   - Add metadata handling

2. **Phase 2: System Prompt Updates**
   - Refine data gathering prompts
   - Enhance analysis prompts
   - Add content status tracking

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Validation**
   - Test with various query types
   - Verify content presentation
   - Monitor performance metrics

### 4. Expected Benefits

1. **Improved Content Delivery**: Ensure all gathered information reaches the user
2. **Better State Management**: Clear tracking of content status
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: More accurate and complete responses
4. **Reduced Information Loss**: Prevent valuable content from being lost

### 5. Testing Plan

1. Test with the cancer research query that revealed the issue
2. Verify proper presentation of gathered data
3. Check handling of different query types
4. Monitor system performance
5. Validate user experience improvements

## Conclusion

This enhancement plan addresses the critical issue of content presentation in the message handling pipeline. By implementing clear state tracking and improving the response formatter, we ensure that valuable gathered information is properly presented to users, significantly improving the overall system effectiveness.
