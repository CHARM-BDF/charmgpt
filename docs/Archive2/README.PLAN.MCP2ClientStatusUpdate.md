# MCP Server to Client Status Update Integration Plan

## Progress Update

### Phase 1: Investigation and Setup ✅
1. **Verify MCP Logging Messages** ✅
   - Added debug logging to `chat.ts`
   - Confirmed MCP server logs are visible in server console
   - Verified `server.sendLoggingMessage()` is working correctly

2. **Understand MCP SDK Logging** ✅
   - Confirmed MCP SDK supports logging capability
   - Identified notification handler mechanism for log messages
   - Verified log message structure and levels

### Phase 2: Implementation (In Progress)
1. **MCPService Logging Integration** ✅
   - Added `MCPLogMessage` interface
   - Implemented `setLogMessageHandler` in MCPService
   - Added notification handling for log messages
   - Added proper type checking and validation

2. **Client-Side Status Updates** (Next Step)
   - [ ] Connect MCPService log handler to chat route's status update system
   - [ ] Test log message flow from MCP server to client
   - [ ] Verify status updates appear in UI

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - [ ] Add visual indicators for different log levels
   - [ ] Implement collapsible log sections
   - [ ] Add timestamp display for log messages

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Test with multiple MCP servers running
   - [ ] Verify log messages from different tools
   - [ ] Check error handling and recovery

2. **Performance Testing**
   - [ ] Monitor message throughput
   - [ ] Check for any UI lag with many updates
   - [ ] Verify memory usage

### Phase 4: Enhancements
1. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Add log filtering by level
   - [ ] Implement log search/filter
   - [ ] Add log export functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Connect MCPService log handler to chat route
   ```typescript
   // In chat.ts route handler:
   const mcpService = req.app.locals.mcpService as MCPService;
   mcpService.setLogMessageHandler(sendMCPLogMessage);
   ```

2. **Testing Plan**
   - Test with the medik-mcp server's existing logging
   - Verify log messages appear in client UI
   - Check formatting and display of different log levels

3. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation with new logging features
   - Add examples of log message handling
   - Document UI status update features

## Implementation Notes

1. **MCPService Logging**
   - Successfully implemented notification handling
   - Added type safety for log messages
   - Proper error handling in place

2. **Next Implementation Focus**
   - Connect log handler to status updates
   - Test with actual MCP tool execution
   - Verify UI updates

3. **Potential Challenges**
   - Managing multiple concurrent tool executions
   - Handling high-frequency log messages
   - Maintaining UI responsiveness

## Questions to Address
1. Should we implement log level filtering on the server side or client side?
2. Do we need to store log messages for later reference?
3. Should we add a separate UI panel for detailed logging?

Would you like to proceed with implementing the connection between the MCPService log handler and the chat route's status update system?
