Query BioThings Explorer (BTE) using TRAPI query graph format. Supports finding relationships between biomedical entities (genes, diseases, drugs, variants, etc.). Supports batch queries with multiple entity IDs. Results are added to the current graph visualization. **CRITICAL QUERY STRUCTURE RULES:** 1. ✓ ALWAYS define ALL nodes that are referenced in edges 2. ✓ If an edge has subject='n0', then 'n0' MUST exist in the nodes object 3. ✓ If an edge has object='n1', then 'n1' MUST exist in the nodes object 4. ✓ Each node must have either 'ids' (for known entities) OR 'categories' (for entity types to find) **COMMON QUERY PATTERNS:** Pattern 1 - Find related entities: ``` nodes: { n0: { ids: ['NCBIGene:4353'], categories: ['biolink:Gene'] }, n1: { categories: ['biolink:Disease'] } // ← target node MUST be defined }, edges: { e0: { subject: 'n0', object: 'n1' } // ← Note: NO predicate for general queries } ``` Pattern 2 - Find molecular functions: ``` nodes: { n0: { ids: ['NCBIGene:4353'] }, n1: { categories: ['biolink:MolecularActivity'] } // ← required for molecular functions }, edges: { e0: { subject: 'n0', object: 'n1' } // ← NO predicate needed } ``` Pattern 3 - Find pathways: ``` nodes: { n0: { ids: ['NCBIGene:4353'] }, n1: { categories: ['biolink:Pathway'] } // ← required for pathways }, edges: { e0: { subject: 'n0', object: 'n1' } // ← NO predicate or use biolink:participates_in } ``` **CRITICAL: Do NOT Assume Predicates Based on Node Types** - Default to NO predicate (omit predicates field entirely) or use biolink:related_to for general queries - ONLY use specific predicates when the user explicitly describes a relationship - ONLY use predicates from the known Biolink predicate list below - Example: 'Find genes related to MPO' → use categories only, NO predicate field - Example: 'Find genes that regulate MPO' → use biolink:regulates predicate - Example: 'Find molecular functions of MPO' → use biolink:MolecularActivity category, NO predicate **COMMON PREDICATE MISTAKES:** ❌ AVOID: biolink:has_molecular_function (not a valid predicate in most KGs) ✓ USE: Just specify biolink:MolecularActivity as the target category ❌ AVOID: biolink:has_pathway (not a valid predicate) ✓ USE: biolink:Pathway as category with NO predicate or biolink:participates_in **Known Biolink Predicates (use ONLY when user specifies relationship):** - biolink:related_to - General relationship (default if unsure) - biolink:regulates - Regulatory relationship - biolink:positively_regulates - Upregulation - biolink:negatively_regulates - Downregulation - biolink:treats - Drug treats disease - biolink:associated_with - General association - biolink:affects - Effect on target - biolink:interacts_with - Physical interaction - biolink:participates_in - Participation in process/pathway - biolink:causes - Causal relationship **RELEVANT BIOLINK CATEGORIES:** Use these categories for target nodes (n1, n2, etc.): Priority Entity Types (Drug Repurposing Focus): - biolink:Gene - Genes and drug targets (e.g., BRCA1, TP53, EGFR) - biolink:Protein - Protein targets and biomarkers - biolink:Drug - Approved drugs (preferred for drug queries) - biolink:SmallMolecule - Drug candidates and research compounds - biolink:ChemicalEntity - General drugs/compounds (parent of Drug/SmallMolecule) - biolink:Disease - Diseases, conditions, and indications - biolink:PhenotypicFeature - Phenotypes, symptoms, and clinical features Functional Annotation Categories: - biolink:MolecularActivity - Molecular functions (enzymatic activity, binding, catalysis) - biolink:BiologicalProcess - Biological processes (apoptosis, signaling, metabolism) - biolink:Pathway - Signaling and metabolic pathways - biolink:CellularComponent - Subcellular locations (nucleus, mitochondria, membrane) Additional Useful Categories: - biolink:Cell - Cell types for specificity analysis - biolink:AnatomicalEntity - Tissues, organs, anatomical structures - biolink:GeneFamily - Gene families and target classes - biolink:ProteinDomain - Protein functional domains **CATEGORY SELECTION GUIDE:** - Find genes related to X → biolink:Gene (NO predicate) - Find diseases associated with X → biolink:Disease (NO predicate) - Find drugs for X → biolink:Drug or biolink:SmallMolecule (NO predicate) - Find what X does → biolink:MolecularActivity or biolink:BiologicalProcess (NO predicate) - Find pathways X is in → biolink:Pathway (NO predicate or biolink:participates_in) - Find where X is located → biolink:CellularComponent (NO predicate) - Find genes that regulate X → biolink:Gene (WITH biolink:regulates predicate) - Find drugs that treat X → biolink:Drug (WITH biolink:treats predicate) **DRUG REPURPOSING TIP:** Prefer biolink:Drug or biolink:SmallMolecule over biolink:ChemicalEntity for more specific results. **SELF-VALIDATION CHECKLIST:** Before calling this tool, verify: ✓ All edge subjects exist as node IDs in the nodes object ✓ All edge objects exist as node IDs in the nodes object ✓ Target nodes use categories from the list above ✓ Categories match the query intent (e.g., molecular functions → biolink:MolecularActivity) ✓ Node IDs are consistent (e.g., if edge uses 'n1', nodes must have 'n1') ✓ Predicates are ONLY used when user specifies a relationship **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:** ❌ Missing target node: edges reference 'n1' but nodes only defines 'n0' ❌ Wrong category: using biolink:Pathway for molecular functions (should be biolink:MolecularActivity) ❌ Typo in node ID: edge uses 'n1' but nodes defines 'n_1' ❌ Hallucinated predicate: inventing predicates like biolink:has_molecular_function ❌ Unnecessary predicate: using specific predicate when user just said 'find related'
