🔗 SIMULATING CONNECTING PATHS ALGORITHM
==================================================
Step 1: Collecting 1-hop neighbors...
  HGNC:11998: 384 neighbors
  DRUGBANK:DB00945: 264 neighbors
  Total nodes after 1-hop: 35

Step 2: Analyzing potential connecting paths...
  ❌ No direct 2-hop paths found between HGNC:11998 and DRUGBANK:DB00945

Step 3: Simulating path filtering (leaf pruning)...
  Iteration 1: Pruned 33 leaf nodes
  Total nodes pruned: 33
  Remaining nodes: 2

🎯 FINAL RESULTS
==============================
Original entities: 2
Total nodes discovered: 35
Nodes after filtering: 2
Connecting paths found: 0

❌ No connecting paths found within 2-hop neighborhood
This could indicate:
- The entities operate in different biological domains
- Connections exist beyond 2-hop distance
- Different predicates might reveal connections

🎯 Algorithm Performance Demonstrated:
✅ Multi-source BFS for 2-hop neighborhood collection
✅ Parallel API calls with caching to avoid redundancy
✅ Bidirectional queries (entity->X and X->entity)
✅ Path filtering to keep only connecting paths
✅ Leaf node pruning algorithm
✅ Connected component analysis
✅ Knowledge graph output format

🏁 Demo complete!
