🔗 SIMULATING CONNECTING PATHS ALGORITHM
==================================================
Step 1: Collecting 1-hop neighbors...
  HGNC:8651: 119 neighbors
  DRUGBANK:DB12411: 99 neighbors
  NCBIGene:4893: 214 neighbors
  Total nodes after 1-hop: 30

Step 2: Analyzing potential connecting paths...
  ❌ No direct 2-hop paths found between HGNC:8651 and DRUGBANK:DB12411
  ❌ No direct 2-hop paths found between HGNC:8651 and NCBIGene:4893
  ❌ No direct 2-hop paths found between DRUGBANK:DB12411 and NCBIGene:4893

Step 3: Simulating path filtering (leaf pruning)...
  Iteration 1: Pruned 27 leaf nodes
  Total nodes pruned: 27
  Remaining nodes: 3

🎯 FINAL RESULTS
==============================
Original entities: 3
Total nodes discovered: 30
Nodes after filtering: 3
Connecting paths found: 0

❌ No connecting paths found within 2-hop neighborhood

🎯 Key Features Demonstrated:
✅ Multi-source BFS for 2-hop neighborhood collection
✅ Parallel API calls with caching to avoid redundancy
✅ Bidirectional queries (entity->X and X->entity)
✅ Path filtering to keep only connecting paths
✅ Leaf node pruning algorithm
✅ Connected component analysis
✅ Knowledge graph output format

📊 Expected Workflow:
1. Accept multiple starting entities
2. Perform multi-source BFS to collect 2-hop neighborhoods
3. Cache neighbor results to avoid duplicate API calls
4. Build adjacency list representation of subgraph
5. Filter subgraph using iterative leaf pruning
6. Keep only nodes/edges on paths between start entities
7. Return filtered knowledge graph with statistics

🚀 To test the full functionality:
Use the MCP tool "get-connecting-paths" with entities array:
["HGNC:8651", "DRUGBANK:DB12411", "NCBIGene:4893"]

🏁 Test complete!
