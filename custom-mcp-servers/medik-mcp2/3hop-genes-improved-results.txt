3-HOP CONNECTING PATHS TEST RESULTS (IMPROVED STRATEGY)
================================================================================
Test Date: 2025-05-28T20:34:48.090Z
Test Entities: HGNC:2908, HGNC:2364, HGNC:3354
Strategy: Two-phase (parallel + sequential retry) with final filtering
HGNC:2908 = DDIT3 (DNA damage inducible transcript 3)
HGNC:2364 = CEBPB (CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta)
HGNC:3354 = EGR1 (early growth response 1)

🔍 PHASE 1: Fetching direct neighbors of start entities...
  Processing HGNC:2908...
    ✅ Found 207 neighbors
  Processing HGNC:2364...
    ✅ Found 155 neighbors
  Processing HGNC:3354...
    ✅ Found 153 neighbors

Level 1 complete: 36 nodes

🔍 PHASE 2: Fetching level 2 neighbors with retry strategy...
  Processing level 1 node: UMLS:C0598312
    ✅ Added 5 level 2 neighbors
  Processing level 1 node: UMLS:C0034865
    ✅ Added 5 level 2 neighbors
  Processing level 1 node: UMLS:C0031715
    ✅ Added 5 level 2 neighbors
  Processing level 1 node: UMLS:C0243192
    ❌ No level 2 neighbors found
  Processing level 1 node: UMLS:C0162638
    ❌ No level 2 neighbors found
  Processing level 1 node: UMLS:C0040649
    ❌ No level 2 neighbors found
  Processing level 1 node: UMLS:C0037083
    ❌ No level 2 neighbors found
  Processing level 1 node: UMLS:C0007634
    ❌ No level 2 neighbors found
Level 2 complete: 12 nodes added
Success rate: 3/8 level 1 nodes processed

🔗 ANALYZING CONNECTING PATHS...
  Checking 2-hop paths (1 intermediate):
    🔗 2 paths: HGNC:2908 ↔ [intermediate] ↔ HGNC:2364
    🔗 1 paths: HGNC:2908 ↔ [intermediate] ↔ HGNC:3354
  Checking 3-hop paths (2 intermediates):

🎯 FINAL FILTERING: Keeping only nodes on connecting paths...
  Total nodes discovered: 51
  Nodes on connecting paths: 6
  Nodes pruned: 45 (88%)

🎯 FINAL RESULTS (MCP-STYLE OUTPUT)
========================================
Connecting paths found: 3
  - 2-hop paths: 3
  - 3-hop paths: 0

📋 CONNECTING PATHS (FINAL OUTPUT):
----------------------------------------
2-HOP PATHS:
  1. HGNC:2908 ↔ UMLS:C0037083 ↔ HGNC:2364
  2. HGNC:2908 ↔ UMLS:C0007634 ↔ HGNC:2364
  3. HGNC:2908 ↔ UMLS:C0017262 ↔ HGNC:3354


📊 FINAL GRAPH STATISTICS:
  - Nodes in final graph: 6
  - Edges in final graph: 6
  - Starting entities: 3
  - Intermediate nodes: 3

🎯 STRATEGY PERFORMANCE:
✅ Two-phase fetching implemented
✅ Sequential retry for failed requests
✅ Final filtering to path-only nodes
✅ MCP-style output (only relevant results)
✅ Server-friendly request pattern

🏁 Improved 3-hop test complete!
