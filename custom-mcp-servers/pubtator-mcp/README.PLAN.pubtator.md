# PubTator MCP Enhancement Plan

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Planning  
**Priority:** High  

## üéØ Overview

The current PubTator MCP only uses the **article-centric** approach (`/publications/export/biocjson`) which provides entities and relationships within specific papers. However, PubTator 3.0 also supports **entity-centric** queries (`/relations`) that can provide much richer relationship data across all of PubMed.

## üîç Current State Analysis

### What We Have Now
- **Single Tool**: `annotate-pmids` - extracts entities from specific PubMed papers
- **Limited Relationships**: Only creates generic "co-occurs with" relationships between entities in the same paper
- **Article-Centric**: Relationships are limited to what's mentioned in specific papers
- **Basic Knowledge Graph**: Simple co-occurrence network without semantic meaning

### What We're Missing
- **Entity-Centric Queries**: Access to relationships across all of PubMed for any entity
- **Semantic Relationships**: Rich relationship types like "treats", "causes", "correlates with"
- **Publication Evidence**: Count of supporting publications for each relationship
- **Comprehensive Networks**: Full biomedical knowledge graphs for entities

## üöÄ Proposed Enhancements

### 1. New Tool: `find-entity-relations`

**Purpose**: Find all relationships for a specific biomedical entity across PubMed

**Input Schema**:
```typescript
{
  name: "find-entity-relations",
  description: "Find all relationships for a specific biomedical entity across PubMed using PubTator's entity-centric API",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      entity_id: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Entity identifier (e.g., '@GENE_JAK1', '@CHEMICAL_Curcumin', '@DISEASE_Arthritis_Psoriatic')"
      },
      relation_type: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Optional: Filter by relationship type (e.g., 'positive_correlate', 'negative_correlate', 'stimulate', 'associate')"
      },
      max_results: {
        type: "number",
        default: 100,
        description: "Maximum number of relationships to return"
      }
    },
    required: ["entity_id"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Knowledge Graph Structure

**Current Structure** (Co-occurrence):
```json
{
  "links": [
    {
      "source": "JAK1",
      "target": "COVID-19", 
      "label": "co-occurs with",
      "value": 1,
      "evidence": ["PMID123"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Enhanced Structure** (Semantic Relationships):
```json
{
  "links": [
    {
      "source": "@GENE_JAK1",
      "target": "@CHEMICAL_Curcumin",
      "label": "associate",
      "value": 1,
      "evidence": ["PMID1", "PMID2"],
      "relationship_type": "associate",
      "publications": 1,
      "confidence": "high"
    },
    {
      "source": "@DISEASE_Arthritis_Psoriatic",
      "target": "@GENE_JAK1", 
      "label": "stimulate",
      "value": 1,
      "evidence": ["PMID3"],
      "relationship_type": "stimulate",
      "publications": 1,
      "confidence": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Relationship Types Discovered

From testing `/relations?e1=@GENE_JAK1`, we found these relationship types:

- **`negative_correlate`**: Negative correlations (e.g., JAK1 ‚Üî IFNG, IL1B)
- **`positive_correlate`**: Positive correlations (e.g., JAK1 ‚Üî Emodin, Serotonin)
- **`stimulate`**: Disease stimulation relationships (e.g., Arthritis Psoriatic ‚Üí JAK1)
- **`associate`**: General associations (hundreds of chemicals, diseases, genes)

### 4. Entity ID Formats

**Discovered Formats**:
- **Genes**: `@GENE_JAK1`, `@GENE_IFNG`, `@GENE_IL1B`
- **Chemicals**: `@CHEMICAL_Curcumin`, `@CHEMICAL_Serotonin`, `@CHEMICAL_Emodin`
- **Diseases**: `@DISEASE_Arthritis_Psoriatic`, `@DISEASE_Acne_Vulgaris`

## üìã Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add Entity-Centric Tool
1. **Add new tool** `find-entity-relations` to `src/index.ts`
2. **Implement API call** to `/relations?e1={entity_id}`
3. **Add response parsing** for relationship data
4. **Create formatting functions** for entity-centric responses

### Phase 2: Enhance Knowledge Graph Creation
1. **Update `createKnowledgeGraphFromAnnotations`** to handle entity-centric data
2. **Add relationship type mapping** (negative_correlate ‚Üí "negatively correlates with")
3. **Include publication evidence** in relationship metadata
4. **Add confidence scoring** based on publication count

### Phase 3: Hybrid Approach
1. **Combine both approaches**: Article-centric for paper analysis, entity-centric for network exploration
2. **Add tool selection logic**: Choose appropriate approach based on user intent
3. **Create unified knowledge graph format** that works with both data sources

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. **Add relationship filtering** by type, confidence, publication count
2. **Implement entity ID conversion** (NCBI Gene ID ‚Üí @GENE_ format)
3. **Add batch entity queries** for multiple entities at once
4. **Create relationship pathfinding** between entities

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoint Integration
```typescript
// New function for entity-centric queries
async function makeEntityRelationsRequest(entityId: string, relationType?: string, maxResults: number = 100): Promise<any> {
  const url = new URL(`${API_BASE_URL}/relations`);
  url.searchParams.set('e1', entityId);
  if (relationType) {
    url.searchParams.set('type', relationType);
  }
  
  const response = await fetch(url.toString());
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Entity relations request failed: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
  }
  
  return await response.json();
}
```

### Enhanced Knowledge Graph Creation
```typescript
function createKnowledgeGraphFromEntityRelations(relationsData: any[]): KnowledgeGraph {
  const nodes = new Map<string, GraphNode>();
  const links: GraphLink[] = [];
  
  for (const relation of relationsData) {
    // Create nodes for source and target entities
    const sourceNode = createNodeFromEntityId(relation.source);
    const targetNode = createNodeFromEntityId(relation.target);
    
    // Create semantic relationship link
    links.push({
      source: relation.source,
      target: relation.target,
      label: mapRelationshipType(relation.type),
      value: relation.publications,
      evidence: [], // Could be populated with PMIDs if available
      relationship_type: relation.type,
      publications: relation.publications,
      confidence: calculateConfidence(relation.publications)
    });
  }
  
  return { nodes: Array.from(nodes.values()), links, filteredCount: 0, filteredNodeCount: 0 };
}
```

## üéØ Expected Benefits

4. **API Documentation**: Document new endpoints and response formats

### Example Documentation
```markdown
## Entity-Centric Queries

### Find All Relationships for JAK1
```bash
find-entity-relations entity_id="@GENE_JAK1" max_results=50
```

### Find Only Drug-Gene Associations
```bash
find-entity-relations entity_id="@GENE_JAK1" relation_type="associate" max_results=20
```

### Find Disease-Gene Stimulation Relationships
```bash
find-entity-relations entity_id="@GENE_JAK1" relation_type="stimulate"
```
```

## üéâ Conclusion

The entity-centric approach represents a **major enhancement** to the PubTator MCP, transforming it from a simple paper annotation tool into a comprehensive biomedical relationship discovery platform. This enhancement will provide users with:

- **Semantic relationships** instead of generic co-occurrence
- **Comprehensive entity networks** across all of PubMed
- **Evidence-based relationships** with publication support
- **Flexible querying** for both paper and entity analysis

The implementation should be **phased and backward-compatible**, ensuring existing users can continue using the current functionality while new users can access the enhanced capabilities.
