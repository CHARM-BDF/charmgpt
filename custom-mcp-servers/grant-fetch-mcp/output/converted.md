Funding Opportunity Purpose

This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) provides funding to conduct efficacy studies in an established rare disease preclinical model to demonstrate that a proposed therapeutic agent warrants further development. In addition to preclinical efficacy, accompanying pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies would be supported. Therapeutic agents include small molecules, biologics or biotechnology-derived products. The goal of this NOFO is to spur therapeutic development for a variety of rare diseases by advancing projects to the point where they would attract subsequent investment supporting full Investigational New Drug (IND) application development or progression to clinical trials in the case of repurposing or repositioning.

## Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description

**Background and Funding Purpose**

The NIH supports research on a broad range of diseases that are defined as rare; that is, diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. While individually, each rare disease affects a limited number of individuals, when viewed collectively, rare diseases represent a significant unmet medical need. Approximately 30 million people in the United States are living with one of the estimated 10,000 rare diseases; many of which affect children and are serious or life-threatening. Despite advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of many rare diseases, and large investments by pharmaceutical and biotech industries, effective treatments are available for fewer than 5% of diseases. This dearth is a result of myriad interconnected factors including: 1) low disease prevalence resulting in fewer patients, clinicians, researchers; 2) fewer resources given a smaller market size; 3) high developmental failure rates resulting from a lack of high-quality preclinical data in disease-specific models.

Further, the transition from early drug discovery efforts (assay development, high-throughput screening, counter/orthogonal screening, medicinal optimization) to full IND-enabling work is hampered by a lack of funding to support high-quality efficacy testing. These pharmacology studies are expensive, particularly when the studies are designed for rigorous evaluation that would support progression to an IND-enabling enterprise. This results in significant delays in development of potential therapeutics and leaves projects without a path forward. In order to address these issues, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) invites applications aiming to develop or repurpose therapeutics to treat a rare disease with an unmet medical need. It is the intent of this opportunity to fund a diverse set of applications focused on a variety of rare disease indications.

**Research Objectives and Scope**

This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) solicits applications that propose to conduct efficacy studies in an established rare disease preclinical model to demonstrate proof of concept that a proposed therapeutic agent warrants further development. In addition to preclinical efficacy, accompanying pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies would be supported. In preclinical efficacy studies, a combination of efficacy, (PD) and (PK) measures are warranted to determine the feasibility of a candidate therapeutic agent to serve as a starting point for further therapy development. Combined measures of PK and PD greatly increase the understanding of the in vivo efficacy of the therapeutic agent by exploring the relationship between the concentration of the agent at the site of action and the resulting efficacy measures.

For the purposes of this NOFO, efficacy measures reflect the effects of the therapeutic agent on endpoints that are closely tied to the desired clinical endpoints, but do not necessarily reflect target engagement. While PD measures may also reflect the effects of the therapeutic agent on endpoints closely tied to the desired clinical endpoint, they must also reflect target engagement. PK measurements reflect the body’s effect on the absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion of the therapeutic agent. While not required, PK to provide evidence that the therapeutic agent has the potential to be therapeutically viable and support the robustness of the efficacy data, is encouraged, if the limited R21 budget can accommodate such studies.

Efficacy studies should be conducted in an established and validated rare disease model. These models may include both in vivo models and/or in advanced in vitro models (e.g. tissue chip/microphysiologic systems). Data supporting relevance and validation of the model to the indicated rare disease should be included in the application. Funding will not be provided for model development; evidence supporting access to the model, in suitable numbers to support rigorous efficacy studies, must be provided.  A letter of support if the animals will be provided by a collaborator, or a quote for purchase must be included in the Letters of Support attachment.    

To ensure both the relevance of the proposed development of the therapeutic agent, as well as the disease model, a plan for a partnership with a rare disease steering/oversight committee is required to submit to this NOFO. However, neither the members of the committee nor the organizations that might partner should be named in the application This committee may be formed de novo with members having appropriate disease relevant expertise and/or experience and could include a potential financial backer. The plan should include only a description of the type of individuals (expertise, patients and/or advocates, foundation representatives – do NOT name the foundation, etc.) and the planned interactions with the scientific team will need to be clearly described as an Other Attachment as part of the application.  

Further, developing therapeutics requires a multidisciplinary approach. It is encouraged that academic investigators should form collaborations with those knowledgeable in the therapeutic development process, as well as those familiar with the desired properties of the end therapeutic product (such as biostatisticians, technical experts and clinicians). Applicants should consider how they will identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the therapy development process once an award is made. Investigators are expected to work closely with their institutional technology transfer officials, if applicable, to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary intellectual property (IP) arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project. 

**Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO**

The following types of studies are not responsive to this NOFO. Applications proposing such studies will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed or considered for funding.

Please note: The scope of this NOFO differs from [RFA-TR-23-016](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-TR-23-016.html). Both New and Resubmission applications must meet the scope of this NOFO. See non-responsiveness criteria below for restrictions on scope:

-   Studies which do not clearly address a rare disease, defined as diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Evidence supporting rare disease classification may include references confirming the prevalence and additional information if the disease has been granted orphan status by the FDA.
-   Applications requesting support for development of the rare disease model.
-   Applications focused on rare cancers. Applicants focused on rare cancers should seek guidance from NCI’s [Preclinical Therapeutics Grants Branch](https://dtp.cancer.gov/organization/ptgb/default.htm) within the Developmental Therapeutics Program at the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.

## Section V. Application Review Information

## 1\. Criteria

Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11149) are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.

For this particular announcement, note the following:

The R21 exploratory/developmental grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. An R21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. Accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. Preliminary data are not required for R21 applications; however, they may be included if available.

Overall Impact

Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following scored review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have a major scientific impact.

Scored Review Criteria

Reviewers will evaluate Factors 1, 2 and 3 in the determination of scientific merit, and in providing an overall impact score. In addition, Factors 1 and 2 will each receive a separate criterion score. 

Factor 1. Importance of the Research (Significance and Innovation)   

_**Significance**_

-   Evaluate the importance of the proposed research in the context of current scientific challenges and opportunities, either for advancing knowledge within the field, or more broadly. Assess whether the application addresses an important gap in knowledge in the field, would solve a critical problem, or create a valuable conceptual or technical advance.
-   Evaluate the rationale for undertaking the study, the rigor of the scientific background for the work (e.g., prior literature and/or preliminary data) and whether the scientific background justifies the proposed study.

_**Innovation**_

-   Evaluate the extent to which innovation influences the importance of undertaking the proposed research. Note that while technical or conceptual innovation can influence the importance of the proposed research, a project that is not applying novel concepts or approaches may be of critical importance for the field.
-   Evaluate whether the proposed work applies novel concepts, methods or technologies or uses existing concepts, methods, technologies in novel ways, to enhance the overall impact of the project.

_**Specific to this NOFO:**_

-   Evaluate the extent to which the application shows an understanding of the state of the field and the related therapeutic landscape.
-   Evaluate the strength of the evidence validating the model's relevance for the particular rare disease and whether there is clear biological rationale linking the proposed therapeutic target and the rare disease of interest.
-   Evaluate the extent to which the therapeutic agents are ready to be tested for efficacy, either in an in vivo or an advanced in vitro system. 
-   While the approaches may not be innovative, evaluate the likelihood of bringing the field closer to a therapeutic that will be either a substantial improvement over existing therapeutics or is distinct from other therapeutic approaches currently available for the rare disease being targeted.

Factor 2. Rigor and Feasibility (Approach)   

_**Approach**_

-   Evaluate the scientific quality of the proposed work. Evaluate the likelihood that compelling, reproducible findings will result (rigor) and assess whether the proposed studies can be done well and within the timeframes proposed (feasibility).

_**Rigor:**_

-   Evaluate the potential to produce unbiased, reproducible, robust data.
-   Evaluate the rigor of experimental design and whether appropriate controls are in place.
-   Evaluate whether the sample size is sufficient and well-justified.
-   Assess the quality of the plans for analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.
-   Evaluate whether the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex or age, in the design, analysis, and reporting.
-   For applications involving human subjects or vertebrate animals, also evaluate:
    -   the rigor of the intervention or study manipulation (if applicable to the study design).
    -   whether outcome variables are justified.
    -   whether the results will be generalizable or, in the case of a rare disease/special group, relevant to the particular subgroup.
    -   whether the sample is appropriate and sufficiently diverse to address the proposed question(s).
-   For applications involving human subjects, including clinical trials, assess the adequacy of inclusion plans as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research. Considerations of appropriateness may include disease/condition/behavior incidence, prevalence, or population burden, population representation, and/or current state of the science.

_**Feasibility:**_

-   Evaluate whether the proposed approach is sound and achievable, including plans to address problems or new challenges that emerge in the work. For proposed studies in which feasibility may be less certain, evaluate whether the uncertainty is balanced by the potential for major advances.
-   For applications involving human subjects, including clinical trials, evaluate the adequacy and feasibility of the plan to recruit and retain an appropriately diverse population of participants. Additionally, evaluate the likelihood of successfully achieving the proposed enrollment based on age, race, ethnicity, and sex.
-   For clinical trial applications, evaluate whether the study timeline and milestones are feasible.

_**Specific to this NOFO:**_

-   Evaluate the extent to which the studies are designed for rigorous evaluation that would support progression to an IND-enabling enterprise.
-   Evaluate to what extent the proposed efficacy study and PD measures are relevant to the proposed clinical indication.
-   Evaluate the extent to which the in vivo or advanced in vitro models, and preclinical outcome measures to assess efficacy and/or PD, are optimal for the proposed clinical indication.
-   Evaluate whether there is adequate availability of the model proposed for use to ensure success.
-   Evaluate the extent to which the partnership plan is sufficiently detailed and appropriate.

Factor 3. Expertise and Resources (Investigator(s) and Environment)   

_**Investigator(s)**_

Evaluate whether the investigator(s) have demonstrated background, training, and expertise, as appropriate for their career stage, to conduct the proposed work. For Multiple Principal Investigator (MPI) applications, assess the quality of the leadership plan to facilitate coordination and collaboration.

_**Environment**_

Evaluate whether the institutional resources are appropriate to ensure the successful execution of the proposed work.

_**Specific to this NOFO:**_

-   Evaluate the extent to which do the researchers demonstrate sufficient understanding of the experimental design concepts, including rigor and reproducibility, necessary for successful translation of preclinical and therapeutic discovery research to support progression to an IND-enabling enterprise.
-   Evaluate the extent to which the research team and partners have appropriate knowledge and experience on the targeted rare disease.

## 2\. Review and Selection Process

Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by NCATS, in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11154), using the stated review criteria. Assignment to a Scientific Review Group will be shown in the eRA Commons.

As part of the scientific peer review, all applications will receive a written critique.

Applications may undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific and technical merit (generally the top half of applications under review) will be discussed and assigned an overall impact score.

[Appeals](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_2/2.4.2_appeals_of_initial_scientific_review.htm) of initial peer review will not be accepted for applications submitted in response to this NOFO.

Applications will be assigned to the appropriate NIH Institute or Center. Applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications submitted in response to this NOFO. Following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review by the NCATS Advisory Council. The following will be considered in making funding decisions:

-   Scientific and technical merit of the proposed project as determined by scientific peer review.
-   Availability of funds.
-   Relevance of the proposed project to program priorities.

If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request "just-in-time" information from the applicant as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.5.1. Just-in-Time Procedures](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82418). This request is not a Notice of Award nor should it be construed to be an indicator of possible funding.

Prior to making an award, NIH reviews an applicant’s federal award history in SAM.gov to ensure sound business practices. An applicant can review and comment on any information in the Responsibility/Qualification records available in SAM.gov. NIH will consider any comments by the applicant in the Responsibility/Qualification records in SAM.gov to ascertain the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and performance record of managing Federal awards per 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.

## 3\. Anticipated Announcement and Award Dates
