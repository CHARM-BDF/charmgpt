Funding Opportunity Purpose

The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage applications to phenotype and/or perform research on embryonic lethal knockout (KO) mouse strains being generated through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) of which the NIH Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) is a member. The mission of IMPC is to generate a comprehensive catalogue of mammalian gene function that will provide the foundation for functional analyses of human genetic variation. The current (July 19, 2022) IMPC data release includes phenotypic data for 8260 knockout genes. Overall, the IMPC hopes to generate a null mutant and undertake broad-based phenotyping for every gene in the mouse genome. About 30% of these strains are expected to be either embryonic or perinatal lethal, or subviable. However, a large portion of homozygous lethal mutations are expected to have viable heterozygous phenotypes. The scientific community has the unique opportunity to leverage these mouse strains while they are being created and bred as part of the IMPC adult mouse phenotyping effort to perform additional in-depth phenotyping and research.

# Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description

### # **Purpose**

The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is two-fold: 1) to encourage submission of applications to do more in-depth phenotyping on investigator-selected cohorts of embryonic lethal or subviable Knockout (KO) mouse strains generated by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) of which the NIH Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP) is a member; and, 2) to encourage submission of applications to use investigator-selected embryonic lethal, perinatal lethal, or subviable IMPC-generated KO mouse strains in hypothesis-driven research focused on placental defects, structural birth defects, and/or fertility issues. The KOMP2 Program is in its final phase (2022-2027) of production and primary phenotyping of KO strains, and it is anticipated that the number of available strains for analyses by the research community will increase substantially.

In-depth phenotyping and further research using embryonic lethal, perinatal lethal, and subviable KO mouse strains are of strategic importance for several reasons. Most obviously, these genes are critical to embryonic growth, differentiation, and organogenesis. Early lethals have defects in pre- and peri-implantation processes in embryonic or extra-embryonic tissues. Mid-gestational lethals have defects in organogenesis. Lethality in the fetal or immediate perinatal periods (late lethals) indicates failures in the transition to adult functioning organ systems. These mouse strains are extremely useful as models for a range of congenital human diseases, structural birth defects, infertility, and spontaneous miscarriage. Viable heterozygote alleles are likely to be widely represented in human disease because of their haploinsufficiency or dominant phenotypic effects. So, there is significant and complementary value in also phenotyping heterozygote mutants of these KO strains for clinical phenotypes.

**Background**

The mouse has long been an important mammalian model system for the study of gene function in human health and disease. Mouse mutants with phenotypes that mimic human traits have served as critical research tools in understanding the genetics underlying mammalian biology. Equally important, mouse mutants have been the tools used to begin to understand gene function and pathways as the science has moved from gene identification to mammalian functional genomics.

In 2006, the Trans-NIH Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) was launched with the goal of generating KO mutations in 8,500 genes in C57BL/6 mouse lines by deleting all or most of the exons in target genes or producing knockout-first conditional ready alleles. Together with the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program (EUCOMM) and the North American Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program (NorCOMM), these efforts produced knock out embryonic stem cells for 18,000 protein coding genes, as well as live mouse lines, frozen embryos and sperm, and vectors which are available from public repositories under the auspices of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC). The first phase of the KOMP program was completed in 2011.

In 2011 the KOMP program was expanded as the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), funded as a joint trans-NIH and Common Fund program, with the goal of generating and phenotyping mice strains. Since its launch, KOMP2 integrated operations with other members of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Adoption of CRISPR technology in 2014 greatly increased the efficiency of this program. The current (July 19, 2022) IMPC data release includes phenotype data for 8260 knockout genes.

The current phase of the KOMP2 program was funded in 2022 to extend the trans-NIH program for additional five years (2022-2027). The purpose is to support production of approximately 1,200 mutant mouse lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and perform a series of phenotyping assays; representing substantive contribution to completion of all high priority mouse:human orthologs.

**Scope**

A tiered triage approach to the phenotyping of embryonic lethal KO strains to facilitate flexibility in experimental design and economize on breeding strategies is in place. Primary tier screening begins with a careful evaluation of genotype ratios during breeding to generate adult cohorts for the adult phenotyping pipeline. A mid-gestation stage of E12.5 is the initial reference time point for a "first look" at strains deemed embryonic lethal or subviable and for assessment of developmental anomalies. Based on the E12.5 analysis, embryos are triaged for further analyses at either earlier or later time points (e.g., E9.5 or E14.5 in KOMP or E18.5 across other IMPC centers) as recommended by the Bloomsbury Report. The established phenotyping pipeline includes collection of robust, three-dimensional imaging datasets that are accessible and free to be mined through the IMPC data portal ([http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/embryo](http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/embryo "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site")). In addition to the embryonic lethal KO strains, it is important to note two other cohorts of interest: the estimated 15% of perinatal lethal KO strains and 10% of subviable KO strains. These represent cohorts for further study as these are likely to represent models of human structural birth defects as well.

Depending upon the data available from the embryonic lethal pipeline primary tier screening being performed by the IMPC centers, investigators may consider three options when applying for funding through this NOFO:

- Pursue non-hypothesis-driven, non-mechanistic secondary- and/or tertiary tier screening on a select cohort of IMPC-generated KO strains using various approaches. 1) Studies could focus upon the acquisition of more detailed morphological information with any of a variety of 3D imaging modalities (e.g., magnetic resonance, µCT, high resolution epifluorescence microscopy, OPT, and optical coherence tomography). It is impossible to dictate the "best" stage or modality for imaging to discover novel phenotypes as developmental processes vary by embryonic stage and the interests of the investigators should dictate these aspects. The IMPC will continue to play a leadership role in standardizing operating procedures for 3D imaging of embryos in the same manner that they have developed the common protocols for adult phenotyping. Potential applicants are encouraged to visit the IMPC website for updated information \[[http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/embryo](http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/embryo/oLink%20to%20Non-U.S.%20Government%20Site "Link to Non-U.S. Government Site")\]. 2) An optional approach for characterization of gene function would be to perform mRNA expression profiling using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of embryonic tissues to measure global perturbations caused by the KO. Sequencing technologies are continuously evolving; therefore, it is conceivable that this could be applied to embryonic mouse screening, too. 3)Tertiary tier screening would involve more focused phenotyping of strains of interest to individual investigators. These types of analyses could include, but are not limited to, more detailed immunohistochemistry, laser capture micro-dissection, or the development of cell-based assays.
- Pursue a combination of non-hypothesis-driven, non-mechanistic secondary tier screening on a select cohort of IMPC-generated KO strains and hypothesis-driven aim(s) on selected strains. As the KOMP2 phenotyping effort continues (current phase, 2022-2027), it is clear that there will be a significant increase in phenotypic data available on embryonic lethal, perinatal lethal, and subviable KO strains. In an effort to encourage the further use of these data and strains, applications that make use of these IMPC-generated strains, further the phenotyping effort, and incorporate hypothesis-driven research aim(s) will be considered under this FOA. For these studies applicants can use a combination of IMPC and other resources to address their hypothesis.
- Pursue strictly hypothesis-driven research on a select cohort of KOMP-IMPC-generated embryonic lethal, perinatal lethal, and/or subviable KO strains. Applications that have hypothesis-driven aim(s) to study the underlying mechanisms resulting in embryonic lethality, and/or perinatal lethality and/or subviability will also be considered under this FOA. For these studies applicants can use a combination of IMPC and other resources to address their hypothesis.

**Research Interests of Participating Institutes**

The participating NIH Institutes have provided a brief outline of their interests as they relate to the goals of this NOFO. These mission statements are intended to indicate the breadth of the biomedical areas of interest.

**NICHD**

The NICHD is interested in the evaluation and use of embryonic lethal, perinatal lethal, and subviable KO strains exhibiting structural and other defects in embryonic development. This includes, but is not restricted to, defects affecting post-implantation development, gastrulation and organogenesis, especially those that affect multiple organ systems; limb, neural, cardio-vascular, musculoskeletal, urogenital, digestive, and respiratory. Additionally, understanding potential links between fertility status and any co-morbid conditions in the subviable KO strains would be of interest. Finally, evaluation and use of KO lines with defects in trophoblast development, allantois-chorion fusion, or other aspects of placental development or function are of interest. The focus should be on the determination of placental etiology resulting in embryonic lethality at the pathohistological and molecular levels as well as delineating the possible regulatory mechanism(s) affected by loss of gene function.

**NIDCR**

The NIDCR supports research into all areas of dental, oral, and craniofacial biology including but not limited to: aspects of craniofacial development such as neural crest migration and the regulation and disorders thereof; mineralized tissues; and, salivary gland development and function. Studies characterizing embryonic, perinatal, and adult phenotypes of KO mice relevant to dental, oral, and craniofacial biology are welcome.

**ORWH**

The Office of Research on Women’s Health (ORWH) is part of the NIH Office of the Director, and works in partnership with the 28 NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices (ICOs) to ensure that women's health research is part of the NIH scientific framework and supported throughout the biomedical enterprise. ORWH uses a multidimensional framework to represent the intersection of factors that underlie patterns of disease and determinants of health outcomes in populations.

ORWH is interested in supporting biomedical research that considers sex influences and includes adequate plans for collecting and reporting sex-specific data. There is a crucial need to address sex and/or gender influences in basic, translational, interdisciplinary, behavioral, clinical, and/or health services research relevant to women's health, and, where appropriate, include both sexes to better understand the influence of sex as a biological variable ([SABV](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sites/orwh/files/docs/NOT-OD-15-102_Guidance.pdf)) on health and disease. Integrating the purposeful accounting for SABV in biomedical research, from the most basic to the clinical and applied efforts, will fill gaps in our knowledge, and will inform more effective and personalized approaches for women and men. For additional guidance, please review the 2024-2028 NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for the Health of Women ([https://orwh.od.nih.gov/about/trans-nih-strategic-plan-womens-health-research](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/about/trans-nih-strategic-plan-womens-health-research)).

# Section V. Application Review Information

### # 1\. Criteria

Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11149) are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.

Overall Impact

Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following scored review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have a major scientific impact.

Scored Review Criteria

Reviewers will evaluate Factors 1, 2 and 3 in the determination of scientific merit, and in providing an overall impact score. In addition, Factors 1 and 2 will each receive a separate criterion score.

Factor 1. Importance of the Research (Significance and Innovation)

_**Significance**_

- Evaluate the importance of the proposed research in the context of current scientific challenges and opportunities, either for advancing knowledge within the field, or more broadly. Assess whether the application addresses an important gap in knowledge in the field, would solve a critical problem, or create a valuable conceptual or technical advance.
- Evaluate the rationale for undertaking the study, the rigor of the scientific background for the work (e.g., prior literature and/or preliminary data) and whether the scientific background justifies the proposed study.

_**Innovation**_

- Evaluate the extent to which innovation influences the importance of undertaking the proposed research. Note that while technical or conceptual innovation can influence the importance of the proposed research, a project that is not applying novel concepts or approaches may be of critical importance for the field.
- Evaluate whether the proposed work applies novel concepts, methods or technologies or uses existing concepts, methods, technologies in novel ways, to enhance the overall impact of the project.

**Specific to this NOFO:**

Assess whether data generated will be of high value to the broad research community and enhance the KOMP2/IMPC resource.

Factor 2. Rigor and Feasibility (Approach)

_**Approach**_

- Evaluate the scientific quality of the proposed work. Evaluate the likelihood that compelling, reproducible findings will result (rigor) and assess whether the proposed studies can be done well and within the timeframes proposed (feasibility).

_**Rigor:**_

- Evaluate the potential to produce unbiased, reproducible, robust data.
- Evaluate the rigor of experimental design and whether appropriate controls are in place.
- Evaluate whether the sample size is sufficient and well-justified.
- Assess the quality of the plans for analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.
- Evaluate whether the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex or age, in the design, analysis, and reporting.
- For applications involving human subjects or vertebrate animals, also evaluate:
- the rigor of the intervention or study manipulation (if applicable to the study design).
- whether outcome variables are justified.
- whether the results will be generalizable or, in the case of a rare disease/special group, relevant to the particular subgroup.
- whether the sample is appropriate and sufficiently diverse to address the proposed question(s).
- For applications involving human subjects, including clinical trials, assess the adequacy of inclusion plans as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research. Considerations of appropriateness may include disease/condition/behavior incidence, prevalence, or population burden, population representation, and/or current state of the science.

_**Feasibility:**_

- Evaluate whether the proposed approach is sound and achievable, including plans to address problems or new challenges that emerge in the work. For proposed studies in which feasibility may be less certain, evaluate whether the uncertainty is balanced by the potential for major advances.
- For applications involving human subjects, including clinical trials, evaluate the adequacy and feasibility of the plan to recruit and retain an appropriately diverse population of participants. Additionally, evaluate the likelihood of successfully achieving the proposed enrollment based on age, race, ethnicity, and sex.
- For clinical trial applications, evaluate whether the study timeline and milestones are feasible.

**Specific to this NOFO:**

- Evaluate if the approach is appropriate for non-hypothesis driven secondary or tertiary screening, and/or hypothesis-driven research using the KOMP/IMPC resource.
- Evaluate if the approach is appropriate for effectively utilizing the KOMP2/IMPC resource by building upon the primary phenotyping of the IMPC mouse strains available to the community.

Factor 3. Expertise and Resources (Investigator(s) and Environment)

_**Investigator(s)**_

Evaluate whether the investigator(s) have demonstrated background, training, and expertise, as appropriate for their career stage, to conduct the proposed work. For Multiple Principal Investigator (MPI) applications, assess the quality of the leadership plan to facilitate coordination and collaboration.

_**Environment**_

Evaluate whether the institutional resources are appropriate to ensure the successful execution of the proposed work.

Additional Review Criteria

As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, but will not give criterion scores for these items, and should consider them in providing an overall impact score.

Protections for Human Subjects

For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects; 2) adequacy of protection against risks; 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others; 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained; and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.

For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption; 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics; and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11175).

Authentication of Key Biological and/or Chemical Resources

For projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, evaluate the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources.

Budget and Period of Support

Evaluate whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research.

### # 2\. Review and Selection Process

Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by Center for Scientific Review (CSR), in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](file:///C:/Users/mckenziene/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/13V4QPZR/Research%20Draft.doc#_1._Criteria). Assignment to a Scientific Review Group will be shown in the eRA Commons.

As part of the scientific peer review, all applications will receive a written critique.

Applications may undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific and technical merit (generally the top half of applications under review) will be discussed and assigned an overall impact score.

Applications will be assigned on the basis of established PHS referral guidelines to the appropriate NIH Institute or Center. Applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications submitted in response to this NOFO. Following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review by the appropriate national Advisory Council or Board. The following will be considered in making funding decisions:

- Scientific and technical merit of the proposed project as determined by scientific peer review.
- Availability of funds.
- Relevance of the proposed project to program priorities.

If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request "just-in-time" information from the applicant as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.5.1. Just-in-Time Procedures](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82418). This request is not a Notice of Award nor should it be construed to be an indicator of possible funding.

Prior to making an award, NIH reviews an applicant’s federal award history in SAM.gov to ensure sound business practices. An applicant can review and comment on any information in the Responsibility/Qualification records available in SAM.gov. NIH will consider any comments by the applicant in the Responsibility/Qualification records in SAM.gov to ascertain the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and performance record of managing Federal awards per 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.

### # 3\. Anticipated Announcement and Award Dates

After the peer review of the application is completed, the PD/PI will be able to access his or her Summary Statement (written critique) via the [eRA Commons](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11123). Refer to Part 1 for dates for peer review, advisory council review, and earliest start date.

Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.4.4 Disposition of Applications](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=82416).

# Section VI. Award Administration Information

### # 1\. Award Notices

A Notice of Award (NoA) is the official authorizing document notifying the applicant that an award has been made and that funds may be requested from the designated HHS payment system or office. The NoA is signed by the Grants Management Officer and emailed to the recipient’s business official.

In accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.

Recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in [Section IV.6. Funding Restrictions](#_6._Funding_Restrictions). Any pre-award costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the applicant's own risk.  For more information on the Notice of Award, please refer to the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 5. The Notice of Award](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_5/5_the_notice_of_award.htm) and NIH Grants & Funding website, see [Award Process.](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/pre-award-process.htm#award)

Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.

### # 2\. Administrative and National Policy Requirements

The following Federal wide and HHS-specific policy requirements apply to awards funded through NIH:

- The rules listed at [2 CFR Part 200](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200), Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.
- All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11120) as part of the terms and conditions in the Notice of Award (NoA). The NoA includes the requirements of this NOFO. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11120) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=11159).
- If a recipient receives an award, the recipient must follow all applicable nondiscrimination laws. The recipient agrees to this when registering in SAM.gov. The recipient must also submit an Assurance of Compliance ([HHS-690](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/form-hhs690.pdf)). To learn more, see the [Laws and Regulations Enforced by the HHS Office for Civil Rights website](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/laws/index.html).
- HHS recognizes that NIH research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research.
