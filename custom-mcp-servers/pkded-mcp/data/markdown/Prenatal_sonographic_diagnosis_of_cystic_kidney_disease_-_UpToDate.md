INTRODUCTION

Congenital cystic kidney disease is one of the major causes of end-stage kidney disease in children and adults. The clinical presentation may become apparent in the fetus or child, or may be delayed to adulthood. These disorders have a wide spectrum of outcomes depending on whether there is unilateral or bilateral involvement, contralateral disease or compensatory hypertrophy in unilateral cases, other organ involvement, and the extent of kidney damage determined by characteristics of the syndrome complex, if any.

In children, a larger proportion of kidney cysts are due to genetic diseases as compared with adults. A monogenic disease is identified in 50 to 70 percent of cases with two or more kidney cysts and/or increased cortical echogenicity. In cases with extrarenal anomalies, the risk of a chromosomal anomaly is increased. Genetic pathology is less common for solitary cysts with normal kidney parenchyma and in isolated unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) or cystic dysplasia [[1,2](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,2)].

Ultrasound is the most common imaging method for diagnosis of fetal kidney cystic diseases. Congenital cystic kidney diseases that can be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound examination will be reviewed here. The diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and prognosis of kidney cysts and cystic disorders in children are discussed separately, including:
