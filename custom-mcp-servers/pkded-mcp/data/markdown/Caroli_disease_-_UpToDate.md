INTRODUCTION

Caroli disease is a congenital disorder characterized by multifocal, segmental dilatation of large intrahepatic bile ducts [[1,2](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caroli-disease/abstract/1,2)]. The condition is usually associated with renal cystic disease of varying severity. This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of Caroli disease.

TERMINOLOGY

Caroli initially described two distinct disease entities characterized by segmental, saccular dilatations of the **large intrahepatic** bile ducts [[3,4](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caroli-disease/abstract/3,4)].

●Caroli disease – This is characterized by bile ductular ectasia without other apparent hepatic abnormalities.

●Caroli syndrome – Intrahepatic bile duct dilatation is associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis [[5](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caroli-disease/abstract/5)].

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

Prevalence — Caroli disease is rare and is estimated to affect 1 in 1,000,000 individuals. Caroli syndrome is a more common variant than Caroli disease and has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 100,000 individuals [[6](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caroli-disease/abstract/6)].
