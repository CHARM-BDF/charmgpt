# Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Overview

**Tags:** ADPKD, polycystic kidney disease, genetics, autosomal dominant, PKD1, PKD2

## Introduction

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disorder, affecting approximately 1 in 400 to 1 in 1,000 people worldwide. It is characterized by the progressive development of fluid-filled cysts in both kidneys, which can lead to kidney enlargement and eventual kidney failure.

## Genetics

ADPKD is caused by mutations in one of two genes:

### PKD1 Gene
- Located on chromosome 16
- Encodes polycystin-1 protein
- Accounts for approximately 85% of ADPKD cases
- Generally associated with more severe disease progression

### PKD2 Gene  
- Located on chromosome 4
- Encodes polycystin-2 protein
- Accounts for approximately 15% of ADPKD cases
- Generally associated with milder disease progression and later onset of kidney failure

## Clinical Manifestations

### Kidney-Related Symptoms
- Enlarged kidneys (nephromegaly)
- Abdominal pain and discomfort
- Blood in urine (hematuria)
- Kidney stones
- Urinary tract infections
- High blood pressure (hypertension)

### Extra-Kidney Manifestations
- Liver cysts (most common extra-kidney manifestation)
- Brain aneurysms (intracranial aneurysms)
- Heart valve abnormalities
- Hernias
- Diverticular disease

## Diagnosis

### Imaging Studies
- **Ultrasound**: First-line screening tool
- **CT scan**: More detailed imaging when ultrasound is inconclusive
- **MRI**: Gold standard for measuring kidney volume and monitoring disease progression

### Genetic Testing
- Recommended when imaging results are inconclusive
- Useful for family planning decisions
- Important for potential living kidney donors

### Diagnostic Criteria
The diagnosis is typically based on family history and imaging findings:
- Age 15-39: ≥3 cysts in each kidney
- Age 40-59: ≥2 cysts in each kidney  
- Age ≥60: ≥4 cysts in each kidney

## Treatment and Management

### Blood Pressure Control
- ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line therapy
- Target blood pressure: <130/80 mmHg
- Critical for slowing kidney function decline

### Tolvaptan Therapy
- FDA-approved medication for ADPKD
- Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist
- Slows kidney growth and preserves kidney function
- Requires regular liver function monitoring

### Pain Management
- Heat application for cyst-related pain
- Over-the-counter pain relievers (avoid NSAIDs long-term)
- Cyst aspiration or surgery for severe cases

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Adequate hydration (2-3 liters of water daily)
- Low-sodium diet
- Regular exercise
- Avoiding caffeine excess
- Maintaining healthy body weight

## Prognosis

- Highly variable disease progression
- PKD1 mutations generally progress faster than PKD2
- 50% of patients reach kidney failure by age 60 (PKD1) or 70 (PKD2)
- Many patients maintain normal kidney function into their 60s or 70s
