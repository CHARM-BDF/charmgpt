# Review of Specific Aims

## Overall Impression

The proposed research aims to develop and evaluate an AI-based tool for communicating genomic screening results to participants, with a focus on scalability and addressing the limited workforce of genetic counselors. The use of generative AI for this purpose is innovative and has the potential to improve the delivery of genomic information to diverse populations. The research builds upon the existing Alabama Genomic Health Initiative (AGHI) platform, which provides a valuable resource for testing the AI tool in a real-world setting.

## Significance

### Strengths

- The proposed research addresses a significant gap in the ability to effectively communicate genomic information to patients, given the growing demand for genomic testing and the limited workforce of genetic counselors.
- The use of AI technology for communicating genomic results has the potential to be transformative and scalable, enabling more widespread access to genetic counseling services.
- The research aims to enhance the communication of genomic information to diverse populations, which is an important step towards addressing health disparities and promoting health equity.

### Weaknesses

- The significance of the proposed research could be further strengthened by providing more specific details on the limitations of current methods for communicating genomic results and the potential impact of the proposed AI tool on improving patient understanding and outcomes.

## Investigator(s)

### Strengths

- The investigative team appears to have the necessary expertise in genomics, genetic counseling, and AI technology to carry out the proposed research.
- The involvement of a community advisory board and professional advisory group demonstrates a commitment to engaging diverse stakeholders and incorporating their perspectives into the research.

### Weaknesses

- The specific roles and qualifications of the key personnel are not clearly described, making it difficult to fully assess the investigative team's capabilities.

## Innovation

### Strengths

- The use of generative AI technology for communicating genomic results is a novel and innovative approach that has the potential to address the scalability challenges of traditional genetic counseling methods.
- The proposed research incorporates multi-modal large language models and user experience assessments, which are innovative approaches for developing an effective and user-friendly AI tool.

### Weaknesses

- While the use of AI technology is innovative, the specific novelty of the proposed approach compared to existing AI-based tools or methods for communicating genomic information could be better articulated.

## Approach

### Strengths

- The proposed research builds upon an existing genomic medicine implementation science initiative (AGHI), which provides a valuable platform for testing the AI tool in a real-world setting.
- The use of a superiority trial design (Aim 2) is appropriate for evaluating the effectiveness of the AI tool compared to current methods of communicating genomic results.
- The inclusion of both quantitative (surveys) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews) methods for assessing participant experiences and attitudes towards the AI tool is a strength.
- The proposed community and professional stakeholder engagement through focus groups and advisory boards is a positive aspect of the approach.

### Weaknesses

- The specific details of the AI tool refinement process (Aim 1a) and the technical evaluations, user experience assessments, and stakeholder engagement methods could be more clearly described.
- The rationale for the proposed sample sizes and power calculations for the superiority trials (Aim 2) is not provided.
- The approach for analyzing and interpreting the qualitative data from the semi-structured interviews (Aim 3) is not clearly described.

## Environment

### Strengths

- The research appears to be supported by an appropriate environment, with the AGHI platform providing access to a relevant participant population and infrastructure for genomic testing and result communication.

### Weaknesses

- Specific details about the research environment, institutional support, and available resources are not provided, making it difficult to fully assess the suitability of the environment for the proposed research.

## Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP)

The PEDP is not included in the provided Specific Aims section, so it cannot be adequately evaluated. However, the proposed research does appear to have elements that could contribute to enhancing diverse perspectives, such as the involvement of a community advisory board, engagement with diverse stakeholders, and a focus on improving the communication of genomic information to diverse populations.

## Overall Recommendation

The proposed research has significant strengths, including its innovative use of generative AI technology for communicating genomic results, its potential to address a critical gap in the delivery of genomic information, and its focus on promoting health equity by enhancing communication with diverse populations. The approach of building upon an existing genomic medicine implementation science initiative (AGHI) and incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods for evaluating the AI tool is also a strength.

However, there are some weaknesses in the proposal, particularly in the lack of specific details regarding certain aspects of the approach, such as the AI tool refinement process, sample size justification, and qualitative data analysis plan. Additionally, the roles and qualifications of the investigative team could be more clearly described.

Overall, the proposed research has the potential to make important contributions to the field of genomic medicine and address a significant unmet need. With some additional clarification and strengthening of the approach and investigative team sections, this proposal could be considered for funding.
