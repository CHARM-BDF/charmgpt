# CalInfokit Progress Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Project Analysis & Planning
- ✅ Created comprehensive plan document (README.PLAN.CalInfokit.md)
- ✅ Analyzed system components and their interactions
- ✅ Identified key improvement areas
- ✅ Developed a phased implementation strategy

### 2. Documentation
- ✅ Created swift-helper README with build and usage instructions
- ✅ Documented the build process for CalendarHelper
- ✅ Created detailed error handling improvement strategy
- ✅ Documented caching strategy with implementation details

## Current State

The analysis phase is complete, and we now have a clear understanding of the system's architecture:

1. **Swift Helper (CalendarHelper)**
   - Command-line utility using EventKit
   - JSON output for calendar and event data
   - Basic error handling with limited exit codes
   - No caching or filtering capabilities

2. **TypeScript Service (eventkit-service.ts)**
   - Spawns the helper script for each request
   - Handles JSON parsing and error management
   - No caching or advanced error handling

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 1: Stabilization)

1. **Improve Swift binary error handling**
   - Implement structured JSON error output
   - Standardize error codes
   - Add detailed recovery instructions

2. **Implement caching in the TypeScript layer**
   - Add calendar list caching
   - Implement event caching with key generation
   - Add cache management methods

3. **Enhance error handling in EventKit service**
   - Add structured error parsing
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors
   - Improve permission handling and guidance

### Future Tasks (Phase 2 & 3)

1. **Add calendar filtering capability**
   - Either enhance Swift binary or implement in TypeScript
   - Filter by calendar ID
   - Add support for keyword filtering

2. **Performance optimization**
   - Consider daemon mode for helper
   - Evaluate IPC options
   - Optimize process creation

3. **Security enhancements**
   - Sanitize sensitive data in logs
   - Improve permission handling
   - Secure the helper execution

## Implementation Approach

For the immediate tasks, we propose this approach:

1. Start by implementing error handling improvements in the Swift helper
2. Next, add caching to the EventKit service
3. Then enhance error handling in the TypeScript layer
4. Finally, test the full flow end-to-end

## Technical Considerations

- Swift changes require recompiling the binary
- TypeScript changes need to be carefully tested to avoid disruption
- Permission handling is critical for user experience

## Testing Plan

For each implementation:
1. Develop unit tests for the new functionality
2. Create integration tests spanning the Swift and TypeScript layers
3. Perform manual testing focusing on error cases

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1 (Stabilization): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2 (Feature Enhancement): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3 (Performance & Security): 2-3 weeks
